[{"number": 1, "hadith": "Al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba narrated, \u201cThere was no one authentically reported the news of Ali except the companions of Abdullah ibn Masoud.\u201d.", "commentary": "One has to verify the narrators and reports taced back to the Prophet (\ufdfa) and his companions. We narrate the trustworthy and truthful narrators' reports, for some people and reports may not be accepted. We have to be careful, for some may have purposes drawing them to fabricate narrations. In this report, Al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba confirmed that it was only the companions of Abdullah ibn Masoud who narrated the authentic reports about Ali. They were the only people reporting what was authentically narrated about him. After some events of trial like killing Uthman ibn Affan, Ali's fighting Khawarij and others, Muaweya\u2019s rule after Al-Hasan\u2019s abdication, lots of fabricated reports narrated about Ali by whether his supporters or opponents, unlike Abdullah ibn Masoud who just narrated and conveyed authentic reports to his own companions, including reports about Ali. Imam Muslim narrated that Abu Ishaq Amr ibn Abdullah As-Sabe'i narrated, \u201cWhen they fabricated reports after Ali, one of Ali\u2019s companions said, \u2018May Allah kill them! They corrupted every type of knowledge!'\" This refers to the reports that Rawafid and Shia fabricated and inserted to Ali\u2019s knowledge and reports. This hadith contains the following lessons: (1) It illustrates the virtue of Abdullah ibn Masoud and his companions for their accurate conveying the truth and (2) It confirms the necessity of deeply examining the reports before accepting them.."}, {"number": 2, "hadith": "Jaber ibn Abdullah narrated, \"The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa allowed us to eat the flesh of horses but forbade us from eating donkey flesh.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (\ufdfa) used to explain to people the lawful and unlawful foods and drinks which were not stipulated in the Quran. In this hadith, Jaber ibn Abdullah narrated that the Prophet (\ufdfa) allowed consuming horse meat but prohibited consuming the meat of domesticated donkey which is used to serve people, especially farmers in villages. The Prophet (\ufdfa) strictly prohibited it on Khaybar Day in the seventh year after Hijrah. This is due to some things such as: (1) It has benefits for people as in transporting and carrying unlike horses or (2) Its meat is bad. In the two Sahihs, Anas narrated that the Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \u201cVerily, Allah and his Messenger prohibited you from (eating of) the donkey flesh, for it is filthy.\u201d This is unlike the zebra flesh which is permitted in other hadiths. In the two Sahihs, Abu Qatada narrated, \u201cI said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, I hunted a zebra and still have some of its flesh.\u2019 The Prophet (\ufdfa) told people to eat while they were in the state of ihram.\u201d In Sunan Abu Daoud, the Prophet (\ufdfa) forbade them to eat mule flesh. The hadith of Jaber contains the following lessons: (1) It shows the legitimacy of consuming horse flesh and (2) It clarifies the prohibition of consuming domestic donkey flesh.."}, {"number": 3, "hadith": "Yahya ibn Ya\u2019mur narrated, \u201cThe first man who spoke about qadar (divine decree) in Basra was Ma'bad Al-Juhany. Humaid ibn Abderrahman Al-Hemyary and I set out for pilgrimage - or umrah - and said, \u2018If we can only meet someone of the Prophet\u2019s companions \ufdfa, we will ask him about what those people are saying about qadar. Accidentally, we saw Abdullah ibn Omar ibn Al-Khattab while he was entering the mosque. My companion and I surrounded him, one on his right and the other on his left. I expected that my companion would authorize me to speak so I said, \u2018O Abu Abdurrahman! We have some people in our land who recite the Quran and seek knowledge [he added some of their affairs as they claim that there is no divine decree and events were not predestined].\u2019 Abdullah ibn Omar said, \u2018If you meet such people, tell them that I am neither from them nor they are from me. By whom Abdullah ibn Umar swears, if any one of them had given charity of gold equal to the mountain of Uhud, Allah would not have accepted it unless he had believed in the divine decree.\u2019 He further said, \u2018My father, Omar ibn al-Khattab, told me, \u2018Once we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa, a man with deep white clothes and deep black hair came. He neither had signs of travel on him nor any of us recognized him. He sat with the Prophet \ufdfa, placed his knees next to the Prophet\u2019s knees and his palms on the Prophet\u2019s thighs, and said, \u2018O Muhammad, inform me about al-Islam.\u2019 The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u2018Islam is to testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, establish prayer, pay Zakat, observe the fast of Ramadan, and perform pilgrimage if you can bear it.\u2019 He (the inquirer) said, \u2018You have told the truth.\u2019 He (Omar) said, \u2018It amazed us that he asked then verified his truth.\u2019 He (the inquirer) said, \u2018Inform me about iman (faith).\u2019 The Prophet said, \u2018It is to believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and the divine decree, good and evil.\u2019 He (the inquirer) said, \u2018You have told the truth.\u2019 He (the inquirer) said, \u2018Inform me about ihsan.\u2019 He (the Prophet) said, \u2018It is to worship Allah as if you are seeing Him, for though you do not see Him, He sees you.\u2019 He (the enquirer) said, \u2018Inform me about the hour (the last day).\u2019 He (the Prophet) said, \u2018One who is asked about it does not know more about it than the one who is asking.\u2019 He (the inquirer) said, \u2018Inform me about its signs.\u2019 He (the Prophet) said, \u2018That the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress, that you will find barefooted, naked, destitute, goat-herds competing with each other in constructing buildings.\u2019 He (Omar) said, \u2018Then he (the inquirer) went on his way and I stayed for a long while then the Prophet said to me, \u2018Omar, do you know who this inquirer was?\u2019 I replied, \u2018Allah and His Messenger know best.\u2019 He (the Prophet) said, \u2018He was Gabriel (the angel) who came to instruct you the matters of your religion.\u2019\u201d.", "commentary": "Belief in qadar (divine decree) is one of the fundamentals of the Islamic faith. The Prophet (\ufdfa) explained that acting based on lawful means does not contradict it. On the other hand, he warned his nation against those denying divine decree or claiming that it contradicts Islamic faith. This supreme hadith taught us the Islamic religion by clarifying its pillars along with the signs of the Last Day. In this hadith, Yahya ibn Ya\u2019mur reported that the first one who rejected the divine decree was Ma'bad Al-Juhany. He was one of the students of al-Hasan al-Basri. Once he spread his heresy of rejecting the divine decree, Al-Hajjaj imprisoned and killed him. This was in Basra, a city built by Caliph Umar ibn Al-Khattab in the south of Iraq in 17 AH. and inhabited by people in 18 AH. Denying the divine decree means that Allah just knows people's deeds after they occur. His saying, \u201c... in Basra\u201d implies that he was preceded by others who adopted this heresy outside Basra. It was said that this misleading heresy first arose in Mecca when the Kaaba burned and Ibn al-Zubair was trapped by Yazid. Some said it was burned by Allah's decree while others rejected this opinion. It was also said that the first one who rejected the divine decree in Levant was Amr Al-Maqsous. In this hadith, Yahya ibn Ya'mur reported that both he and Humaid ibn Abderrahman Al-Hemyary set out for pilgrimage - or umrah - to the Sacred House in Macca and hoped they met one of the Prophet's companions so they asked him about rejecting the divine decree that some adopted. Accidentally, they saw Abdullah ibn Omar ibn Al-Khattab entering the mosque. They surrounded him, one on his right and the other on his left. Yahya expected that his companion would authorize him to speak due to either his being older or more eloquent than him or that Humaid was too shy to ask. Yahya told Abdullah about what happened and addressed him with his nickname, Abu Abderrahman out of respect. He told him that there were some people in Basra taking much care of the Quran recitation, seeking Islamic knowledge, and spreading some misleading heresies. He mentioned and added some other points so that Abdullah may give them importance. It may mean that he mentioned their doctrine of heresies of denying the divine decree, believing that Allah just knows people's deeds after they occur, proving one's independent ability of Allah, the Almighty, and denying that all things happen based on Allah\u2019s command. When Abdullah ibn Omar heard that, he asked him to inform those people of heresies that he was neither from them nor they were from him, which is a complete repudiation. Then he swore by Allah if any one of them had given charity of gold equal to the mountain of Uhud - a great mountain in Medina -, Allah would not have accepted it unless he had believed in Allah\u2019s divine decree, for believing in the divine decree is one of the faith pillars. Then he told them about the proof of that. He said that his father, Omar ibn al-Khattab, told him that once they were sitting with the Prophet (\ufdfa), a man suddenly came to him. He wore deep white clothes and had deep black hair. He had no signs of travel like being exhausted or dusty. None knew about him either. He placed his knees next to the Prophet\u2019s ones and his palms on the Prophet\u2019s thighs or his own thighs. This refers that he deeply knew the Prophet's prestige. He addressed the Prophet \ufdfa with his name, not his prophethood nickname. Then he asked the Prophet \ufdfa about Islam and its reality. The Prophet \ufdfa told him about the five pillars of Islam: (1) To approve by your heart and testify by your tongue that there is no god worthy of worship but Allah and that Muhammad is his Messenger. It is a correlated testimony. It means that a Muslim utters these two testimonies while acknowledging the oneness of Allah and His right to be worshiped alone without any partners. It means that a Muslim believes in Prophet Muhammad's message and acts upon it. This is the testimony that will benefit us in the Hereafter so we will win Paradise and be saved from Hell, (2) Establishing the prayer: It means to regularly perform the five daily obligatory prayers at their times while fulfilling their conditions and pillars. They are Fajr (Dawn), Dhuhr (Noon), Asr (Afternoon), Maghreb (Sunset), and Isha (Evening), (3) Paying the obligatory zakah: It is an obligatory financial act of worship concerning any property that reaches the limit determined by Islam over an entire lunar year. Generally, 2.5% of one\u2019s savings must be given to the poor and the types determined by Islam. It includes all money sources like cattle, livestock, crops, fruits, merchandise, and buried treasure or metals extracted from the earth. Each source has its own percentage and time of paying to the poor, (4) Fasting Ramadan month: It is to refrain from eating, drinking, intercourse, etc. from dawn to sunset, out of worship, and (5) Pilgrimage to the Sacred House once in one's lifetime on the condition that one is financially and physically able to perform it. Once the Prophet \ufdfa \ufdfa explained the pillars of Islam, the man said to him, \"You have told the truth.\" It means you answered truthfully and correctly, which amazed the attendees, for he asked as if he did not know but he later confirmed the Prophet's answer. Is he a teacher or a learner?! Then he asked the Prophet about the faith's reality. The Prophet \ufdfa told him that it includes six pillars as follows: (1) Belief in Allah: It is to believe in His existence, his attributes of majesty and perfection, his oneness, and his being clear of the attributes of imperfection. It is also to believe that he is the Eternal Refuge, neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent. It is to believe that He is the Creator of all creatures and the only god deserving to be worshiped without any partners, who manages his kingdom however he wills, (2) Belief in angels: It is to believe in the forms in which Allah created them. They are a great creation made of light. They are servants without any divine attributes. They are honored servants forced to obey Allah, the Almighty. They do not disobey Allah but do what he commands them to do. Their real number is only known to Allah. In general, they are different types with various jobs. Some are specifically mentioned in the Quran and Prophet's tradition like Gabriel who is responsible for conveying the divine revelation to prophets, Israfil who is responsible for blowing the trumpet, Michael who is responsible for sending the rain, Angel of Death who is responsible for holding people's souls, etc. A Muslim must believe in them as a whole and their specific details if mentioned, (3) Belief in Allah's books: The Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa, the seal of the Prophets and Messengers, the Torah revealed to Prophet Moses \ufdfa, Injil revealed to Prophet Jesus \ufdfa, the Psalms revealed to Prophet David \ufdfa, and the scriptures of Abraham and Moses \ufdfa. Belief in these books means to believe in their unfabricated original versions which were the word of Allah. A Muslim must believe that the Quran is a judge over these books so it may confirm, abrogate, or even correct their reports, (4) Belief in Allah's Messengers: It is to believe that Allah sent human messengers to people to call them to worship Him alone. A Muslim believes in all Prophets and messengers without any distinction. A Muslim believes in Prophet Muhammad, the seal of Prophets and messengers. He was sent to all people so it is obligatory for all people and Jinns to believe in him and follow his message once they hear of him. Whoever disbelieves in his message disbelieves in all prophets and messengers. A Muslim believes that they were guided ones who were sent to guide people, truthful in their messages from Allah, granted miracles that proved their truthfulness, and conveyed Allah's messages without insertion, deletion, or concealing. A Muslim has to love, dignify, support, and take Prophets as role models, (5) Belief in the Last Day: It means to believe in all events of that day like resurrection, gathering people for reckoning, the balance, the path, Paradise which is a reward for good doers, Hell which is a punishment for bad doers, along with other issues that were authentically proven, (6) Belief in the divine decree: It is to believe in Allah's timeless and eternal knowledge which deeply encompasses all issues' quantities and conditions. It is to fully believe that all things, good or evil, sweet or bitter, and beneficial or harmful are made by Allah\u2019s decree, will, and command. It is to believe that Allah, the Almighty, gives people the ability for what they were created for. The man said, \u201cYou have told the truth.\u201d This proves that belief in the divine decree is a pillar of faith and that Ma\u2019bad al-Juhany\u2019s denial is incorrect and contradictory to the Prophet\u2019s statement and Gabriel\u2019s testimony. In this hadith, the Prophet \ufdfa explained the principle of faith which is the inner ratification and the principle of Islam which is the outward surrender and submission. This means that every believer is a Muslim not vice versa and that belief is the heart\u2019s act while Islam is the limbs\u2019 act. Then the man asked the Prophet (\ufdfa) about ihsan which is related to one\u2019s relationship with Allah, not with people. The Prophet answers, \u201cIt is to worship Allah as if you are seeing Him, for though you do not see Him, He sees you.\u201d The top level of ihsan is to worship Allah as if you are seeing him with your heart and insight. If he finds it hard, he moves to the other level which is to worship Allah while realizing He is seeing and knowing his secrets and outward issues, and nothing may hide from Him. Then the man asked him about the time of the hereafter. The Prophet (\ufdfa) answered, \u201cOne who is asked about it does not know more about it than the one who is asking.\u201d It means that all people are equally unaware of its time. This indicates that he is Allah alone who knows its time. In the Two Sahihs, Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \"Five issues that Allah alone knows.\" He recited Allah's saying, \u201cIndeed, Allah [alone] has knowledge of the Hour and sends down the rain and knows what is in the wombs. And no soul perceives what it will earn tomorrow, and no soul perceives in what land it will die.\u201d (Luqman: 34) These are the keys to the unseen world that Allah only knows. The man said to the Prophet, \"Then inform me about its signs.\" He meant the signs indicating its approach so people may take care, repent, and return to Allah. The Prophet (\ufdfa) mentioned some of its signs such as: (1) \"A slave girl will give birth to her mistress.\" In the Two Sahih, Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \" ... her lord.\" It means her owner and guardian. It was said that it may refer to the abundant disobedience to one's parents in which he deals with his mother as her lord. It was also said that it may refer to Muslims' frequent conquests of unbelievers' countries in which a young slave girl is brought, set free in the Islamic country, embraces Islam, and buys her mother in ignorance of this case so she becomes her mistress, which has already existed. It was also said that a slave girl may give birth to a king so his mother will be among his slaves, (2) \"That you will find barefooted, naked, destitute, goat-herds competing with each other in constructing buildings.\" It means they are competing for their height and abundance without thanking Allah who bestowed on them after poverty, which is proven by the Prophet's hadith in Ahmad and Termidhy when he says, \"The Hour will not be established until the happiest people in the world is Luka' ibn Luka'.\" Afterward, the man went and Omar stayed for a long while then the Prophet asked him, \"O Omar, do you know who this inquirer was?\" Omar replied, \"Allah and His Messenger know best.\" The Prophet answered him that it was Gabriel (the angel) who \"came to instruct you the matters of your religion.\" Gabriel, the Angel, was the reason for the Prophet's answering and teaching his companions this abundant knowledge of Islam and the Hereafter. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) Clarifying Islam's five pillars and faith's six pillars, (2) Mentioning some etiquette of the seeker of Islamic knowledge as modesty, (3) Proving the blessing of seeking knowledge, (4) Knowledge benefits both questioners and answerers, (5) Referring to Prophet's companions' good manners with him, (6) Illustrating Gabriel's forms when meeting the Prophet, (7) Stating the predecessors' attitudes about denying heresies, (8) Mentioning some sects opposing Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah such as Al-Qadareyyah, (9) Desirability of elegant clothes and cleanliness when meeting scholars and kings, for Gabriel came and taught people with his words and appearance, and (11) Reprehending of unnecessary construction.."}, {"number": 4, "hadith": "Jaber ibn Abdullah narrated, \"An-Nou'man ibn Qauqal came to the Prophet (\ufdfa) and said, 'O Messenger of Allah, 'Do you think that if I perform the obligatory prayers, treat as lawful that which is lawful, and treat as forbidden that which is forbidden, will I enter Paradise?' The Prophet \ufdfa said, 'Yes.' In another narration, An-Nou'man said, '... and do not increase upon that.'\".", "commentary": "Allah, the Almighty, imposed obligatory acts and promised those perform them to enter Paradise, out of his mercy and grace. In this hadith, Jaber ibn Abdullah narrated that An-Nou'man ibn Qauqal, who participated in the Battle of Badr and was martyred in the Battle of Uhud, came and asked the Prophet (\ufdfa) if he prayed the obligatory prayers (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghreb, and Isha), avoided everything forbidden by Islam, and fulfilled all obligations of Islam - and in another narration, he said, \u201cAnd did not do more than that.\u201d He means performing obligations, treating as forbidden that which is forbidden, and treating as lawful that which is lawful - would this make him directly enter Paradise without any torment? The Prophet (\ufdfa) answered, \u201cYes,\u201d This means if he fulfills that, he will enter Paradise. Finally, this hadith confirms that performing obligations, avoiding prohibitions, and knowing the permissible acts lead to Paradise. This is out of Allah\u2019s grace upon Muslims.."}, {"number": 5, "hadith": "Abu Saeed Al-Khudry narrated that people from Abdulqais tribe came to the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa and said, \u201cO Prophet of Allah \ufdfa, we are a tribe from Rabi'a tribes and Mudar unbelievers live between you and us so we can just come to you during the sacred months. Command us to do something that we can command our tribe to do so we will enter Paradise if we follow it.\u201d The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u201cI command you to do four and avoid four: I command you to worship Allah and associate none with Him, establish prayer, pay zakat, observe the fast in Ramadan, and pay the one-fifth out of the booty. I prohibit you from four: Ad-Dubbaa (dry receptacles of gourds), al-hantam (jars made of mud, hair, and blood), al-muzaffat (receptacles covered with tar), and an-naqir.\u201d They asked, \u201cO Prophet of Allah \ufdfa, do you know what an-naqir is?\u201d He replied, \u201cYes, it is a stump that you hollow and in which you throw small dates - Saeed (one of this hadith's narrator) said, \u201cHe (the Prophet) may have said \u201c\u2026dates.\u201d - then you spill water over it to boil then you drink it after it subsides, to the extent that one of you - or one of them - may strike his cousin with the sword.\u201d He (the narrator) said, \u201cThere was a man among people injured due to that (intoxication). I concealed it out of shame from the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa. I asked, 'What type of vessels can we use for drinking?' He (the Prophet) replied, 'In those made of skin tied with a string around their mouths.'\" They said, \u201cO Messenger of Allah \ufdfa, our land abounds in rats so these vessels made of skin cannot remain preserved.\u201d The Prophet \ufdfa said thrice, \u201cEven if they are eaten by rats.\u201d The Prophet \ufdfa said to Ashajj of Abdul-Qais, \u201cVerily, you have two qualities that Allah loves: Patience and deliberation.\u201d In another narration, he (the Prophet) said, \u201c\u2026 then you mix small dates or dates and water into it\u2026\u201d.", "commentary": "The Prophet (\ufdfa) used to gradually teach people Islam\u2019s rules of worship and transactions, permissible and impermissible matters, and all that brought them out of darkness into the light. In this hadith, Abu Saeed Al-Khudri narrated that some people from Abdulqais, a large tribe that inhabited Bahrain in the east of the Arabian Peninsula, came to the Prophet \ufdfa in Media in the month of Rajab in the 8th year. They had converted to Islam before they came. They told him that they were a branch of Rabi\u2019a tribes which represented half of the Arabs. The disbelieved tribes of Mudar lived on Rabi\u2019a\u2019s way to the Prophet (\ufdfa). Mudar was the largest branch of the Arabs in comparison to Rabi\u2019a tribes. Mudar used to attack and rob the caravans and killed all people therein, especially those heading to Medina to convert to Islam. There was open hostility between the two tribes. To travel to the Prophet (\ufdfa), Rabi\u2019a had to pass by Mudar but the safest time to travel to him was during the sacred months, Muharram, Rajab, Dul-Qa\u2019da, and Dhul-Hijja, which all Arabs glorified and avoided fighting therein. As a result, Rabi\u2019a traveled to the Prophet (\ufdfa) in the month of Rajab. Abdulqais delegation asked the Prophet (\ufdfa) to teach them the matters of Islam as they wanted to convey them to their people so they all would enter Paradise if they acted upon them. He commanded them to follow four matters and avoid four matters. He commanded them to: (1) Worship Allah and associate none with Him. Worship is to obey Allah by abiding by his commands that his prophets conveyed. Worship is a comprehensive name for all acts and deeds, apparent and hidden, that Allah loves and pleases. A person declares the oneness of Allah away from any type of polytheism, for whoever does not renounce polytheism does not necessitate that he worships Allah alone, (2) Regular performing the prescribed prayers, Fajr, Duhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha, (3) Paying the obligatory zakat. It is to pay a certain percentage of one's property if it reaches a specific limit and time. One's property includes livestock, harvest, goods, and buried treasures or mines, (4) Fasting during the month of Ramadan. It is a physical act of worship in which a person abstains from eating, drinking, intercourse, and other things from dawn to sunset, and (5) Paying one-fifth out of the booty forcibly obtained from polytheists during wars. Additionally, he forbade them from using four utensils: (1) Ad-Dubbaa: Dry receptacles of gourds, (2) Al-Hantam: Jars made of mud, hair, and blood, (3) Al-Muzaffat: Receptacles covered with tar, and (4) An-Naqir. They astonishingly wondered how the Prophet (\ufdfa) knew an-naqir although it was not used by his people. Thus, he told them that he exactly knew it. He clarified that it was a tree\u2019s trunk that people hollowed and threw small dates therein to be fermented. Then, they spilled water and left it to become wine. Upon drinking it, a person may have struck his cousin with the sword, due to his mind's absence. It was a great evil against which he warned above all other evils. One of the attendants was a man called Jahm ibn Qatham who concealed his injured leg out of shyness of the Prophet (\ufdfa), for he was injured by a drunk man. He forbade them from using these utensils for they rapidly transformed juices into wine which was impure and could not be sold. He forbade them, for it was a waste of one\u2019s properties, and one may have drunk it unknowingly. Later, this prohibition was abrogated by Bureida's narration in Sahih Muslim that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \u201cI forbade you from preparing nabidh (juice of grapes and date) except in a water skin. Now, you can drink from all types of utensils but do not drink anything intoxicating.\u201d In the first hadith, they asked him about vessels they could use for drinking. He guided them to use the water skins. They were light tanned skin taken from animals and their mouths were tied with strings. They did not help juices to be rapidly transformed into wines. They informed him that their land was full of rats overwhelmingly eating water skins. Nevertheless, the Prophet \ufdfa said three times, \u201cEven if they are eaten by rats,\u201d for he believed that they could preserve their water skins away from rats. Later on, he told Al-Ashajj ibn Abdulqais that he had two attributes that Allah and his Prophet \ufdfa loved which were forbearance and patience. These attributes may be innate or acquired by training and practice. This hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It is better to delegate virtuous people to rulers, conveying significant inquiries, (2) The importance of explaining one\u2019s excuse before requests, (3) It shows the important pillars of Islam, (4) The virtue of Al-Ashej due to his good morals, (5) The legitimacy to directly compliment a person if we make sure he will not be tempted, (6) It proves the attribute of love to Allah, in the manner befitting Him, and (7) It clarifies the danger of drinking alcohol and its impact on society.."}, {"number": 6, "hadith": "Tareq ibn Ashyam Al-Ashja'i narrated, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, 'He who says, 'La ilaha illa Allah (there is no true god except Allah)' and disbelieves in what is worshipped besides Allah, his property and blood become inviolable, and his reckoning will be with Allah.\u201d In another narration, he said, \"He who worships Allah alone ...\" Then he mentioned the rest of the hadith..", "commentary": "Islam called people for the oneness and worship of Allah alone without any partner. It secures its followers and entrusts their hearts\u2019 affairs to Allah, the All-Knowing. In this hadith, the Prophet \ufdfa confirms that whoever bears witness and says that \u201cthere is no god but Allah,\u201d i.e. there is no god worthy of worship but Allah and \u201cdisbelieves in what is worshiped besides Allah,\u201d i.e. he renounces all religions except Islam \u201chis property and blood are inviolable.\u201d His property is neither taken nor his blood is shed. In the two Sahihs, Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \u201c\u2026except for a right that is due,\u201d This means that killing a Muslim is not allowable unless he commits a crime that necessitates killing him according to Islam\u2019s rules in three cases: (1) The murderer is killed in retribution, (2) The apostate, and (3) The married adulterer is killed as a punishment. In the two Sahihs, Abdullah ibn Masoud said, \u201cThe Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u2018The blood of a Muslim who testifies that there is no god but Allah and that I am Allah\u2019s Messenger may not be Islamically shed but for one of three reasons: A life for a life, a married one who commits adultery, and a one who abandons Islam and Muslims\u2019 community.\u201d The Prophet said in the first hadith, \u201c\u2026 and his reckoning is with Allah,\u201d This means that we reckon him for the outward obligatory acts but his heart\u2019s affairs are entrusted to Allah Who is the only one who knows what his heart conceals of faith, disbelief, or hypocrisy. Muslims are not commanded to examine people\u2019s hearts, consciences, and beliefs. If one unfaithfully pronounces the faith\u2019s testimony, he will be dealt with according to his outward acts based on the Islamic rules in this world and his reckoning will be with Allah in the hereafter. He will reward him based on his knowledge of his heart. If he sincerely believes, it will benefit him in the hereafter \u2013 as in this worldly life - and save him from the torment. On the contrary, if he does not, it will not benefit him in the hereafter and he will be a hypocrite in Hell. In the two Sahihs, Abdullah ibn Omar narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u201cI have been commanded to fight people till they testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, establish prayer, and pay Zakat. If they do so, their blood and property are safe from me, except for a right that is due, and reckoning them is with Allah.\u201d Anas narrated as in Sahih Bukhari that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \u201cIf anyone observes our form of prayer, faces our prayer destination, and eats our sacrifice, he is the Muslim who has the covenant of Allah and His messenger so do not betray Allah\u2019s covenant.\u201d This clarifies that the testimony of monotheism necessitates fulfilling the remaining pillars of Islam, for whoever denies any of its pillars is an apostate. Finally, this hadith confirms that the testimony of monotheism protects one\u2019s blood, property, and honor.."}, {"number": 7, "hadith": "Abu Huraira narrated, \"The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said to his uncle, 'Say, 'La ilaha illa Allah (there is no god worthy of worship but Allah) so that I can bear testimony for you on the Day of Judgment.' He (Abu Taleb) said, 'Had it not been my fear of Quraysh's blaming and saying that I had done so out of fear, I would have delighted your eyes.' Then Allah revealed, 'Indeed, [O Muhammad], you do not guide whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills.'\" (Al-Qasas: 56).", "commentary": "Guiding hearts is in the hands of Allah alone. Abu Taleb, the Prophet\u2019s uncle, used to strenuously defend and care about him. In this hadith, Abu Hurairah narrated that when Abu Taleb was dying, the Prophet \ufdfa came hoping for his conversion to Islam. He said to him, \u201cSay, \u2018There is no god but Allah.\u2019\u201d He hoped his belief in Allah and saying this word that will save him from punishment in the hereafter. He added, \u201cI will testify thereof for you on the Day of Resurrection.\u201d He means if you say it, you will become a Muslim and I can intercede for you. The Prophet was keen to save and encourage him to be Muslim. On the contrary, Abu Taleb refused and said, \u201c'Had it not been my fear of Quraysh's blaming \u2026\u201d He means they may insult and scold him. Quraysh was the tribe of both. Abu Taleb was afraid that they may say that his fear of death induced him to do so. \u201cI would have certainly delighted your eyes.\u201d He means he would have certainly made him happy and achieved his hopes. Although he believed in all the Prophet said, he neither embraced Islam nor uttered the two testimonies. He remained so until he died a little before the immigration. In another narration in the two Sahihs, Al-Musayyeb ibn Hazn narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \u201cBy Allah, I will keep asking for (Allah\u2019s) forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden to do so.\" So, Allah revealed, \u201cIndeed [O Muhammad] you do not guide whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills.\u201d (Al-Qasas: 56) This means: O Noble Messenger, you do not guide whom you like to Islam such as Abu Taleb but Allah is the only one who guides to Islam whom he wills. He knows best who will be guided to the straight path, based on his knowledge. This hadith clarifies the following: (1) The Prophet\u2019s care for calling people to Islam and saving them from Hell, (2) The Legitimacy of visiting an unbeliever during his illness to call him to Islam, and (3) Being interested and afraid of people\u2019s reactions may sometimes lead to prevent goodness and one's faith.."}, {"number": 8, "hadith": "Uthman narrated, \"The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, 'Whoever dies knowing that there is no god but Allah will enter Paradise.\".", "commentary": "Worshipping Allah alone is the purpose of creating jinn and humankind and the way to save oneself from Hell and win Paradise. In this hadith, the Prophet \ufdfa explains the virtue of monotheism for those who die while believing in it. He said that if one dies while believing in Allah's oneness, worshiping none but him, acting upon the Islamic knowledge, performing the Islamic pillars that the Prophet came with such as prayer, fasting, zakah, pilgrimage, and all acts of worship and goodness, and refraining from evil acts, he will enter Paradise in the hereafter with Allah\u2019s mercy. On the other hand, if he committed sins, Allah would reckon him as He, the Almighty, wills then he would enter Paradise. This is the doctrine of Ahlussunnah. In addition, knowledge is the opposite of ignorance which made this nation neglect the meaning of monotheism testimony. If one ignores its meaning, he will definitely contradict it whether by sayings, deeds, or beliefs. The method to know this testimony is by the following points: (1) Pondering over Allah\u2019s names, attributes, and deeds, (2) Knowing that Allah is the only one who creates and manages his universe so he is worthy of worship alone, and (3) Knowing that Allah is the only one who grants people the obvious and hidden blessings in this world or the hereafter, which makes our hearts love, worship, and cling to Allah, without any partner. The greatest way to achieve these points is to ponder over the Noble Quran, for it is the best method to learn about monotheism. By pondering this great Book, one gets lots of benefits that he cannot get from any other method. A Muslim has to deeply learn about monotheism, for it is the key to Paradise but each key has teeth. Knowledge is one of its teeth that is a prerequisite for making one\u2019s faith useful and accepted.."}, {"number": 9, "hadith": "Abu Hurairah narrated, \u201cWe were with the Prophet \ufdfa on a march then people\u2019s provisions were exhausted to the extent that they were about to slaughter some of their camels.

The one who had wheat came with it, the one who had dates came with them.\u201d In another narration, \u201cThe one who had date-stones came with them.\u201d Talha asked, \u201cWhat did they do with date-stones?\u201d Mujahed answered, \u201cThey were sucking them then drinking water afterward.\" Abu Hurairah resumed his first narration saying, \"The Prophet invoked Allah until all people filled their stuff then said at that time, \u2018I bear witness that there is no god but Allah and I am His messenger.

In this hadith, Abu Hurairah narrated that they were with the Prophet \ufdfa on a march. Imam Muslim mentioned that it was the Battle of Tabouk in the ninth year AH. \"People\u2019s provisions were exhausted.\" In Bukhari's narration, Salama ibn Al-Akwa' narrated, \"People's food ran short and they were in great need,\" to the extent that they were about to slaughter some camels they were riding. Omar ibn Al-Khattab advised the Prophet \ufdfa to collect people\u2019s remaining provisions, invoke Allah to get His blessings, and keep camels for riding and carrying people. The Prophet \ufdfa agreed and asked people to collect food. Each brought his remaining food. \"The one who had wheat came with it and the one who had dates came with them.\u201d Mujahed ibn Jabr (one of this hadith's narrators) narrated, \"The one who had date-stones came with them.\u201d Talha ibn Musarref asked him, \u201cWhat were they doing with the date-stones?\u201d He means it is something that cannot be usually eaten. Mujahed answered, \u201cThey were sucking them then drinking water afterward,\u201d if they did not find dates. This referred to the hardship and poverty they were experiencing and confirmed that the Prophet's companions brought all the food they had and none kept anything for himself. Afterward, the Prophet \ufdfa invoked Allah who blessed the food to the extent that people filled their containers with that food. The Prophet \ufdfa said, \"I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship but Allah and that I am the messenger of Allah.\" He affirmed Allah's oneness and his prophethood and truthfulness in what he received from Allah. This blessing is proof of his prophethood, for it is paranormal. Then he showed that whoever affirms Allah's oneness and Muhammad's prophethood, acts upon these testimonies, and dies while certainly believing in them Allah will enter him Paradise. As a result, people of monotheism will enter Paradise although some of them may be punished in Hell for their sins, but they will not be eternally in it. Finally, this hadith includes the following benefits: (1) It states the Companions' trust and belief in the Messenger of Allah, (2) It mentions the Prophet's apparent miracle proves his prophethood, (3) It shows the Prophet's modesty, for he accepted Omar's opinion and proposal, (4) It shows the possibility of advising the leader if there is a benefit even he does not ask for that, and (5) Desirability of collecting food for people, especially in the time of poverty.."}, {"number": 10, "hadith": "As-Sunabehy narrated, \u201cI went to Ubadah ibn As-Samet when he was about to die and cried.\u201d Ubadah said, \u201cWait, why are you crying?

In the meanwhile, the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) got up and left us. He was late to the extent that we were worried that he might be attacked by some when we were not there. We were alarmed and got up. I was the first to be alarmed. I went out to look for the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa), came to a garden belonging to the Banu An-Najjar, a section of the Ansar, and went round it while saying, \u201cWill I find its door?\u201d but I did not. I saw a stream flowing up a well and going through a wall. I drew myself together and came where the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) was. He asked, \u2018Is it you Abu Hurairah?\u2019 I replied, \u2018Yes, O Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa).\u2019 He said, \u2018What is the matter with you?\u2019 I replied, \u2018You were among us, got up, and were late. We were afraid that you might be attacked by some when we were not there. We became alarmed and I was the first to be alarmed. So when I came to this garden, I drew myself together as a fox does while these people were following me.\u2019 He gave me his sandals and said, \u2018O Abu Huraira! Go with my sandals and give glad tidings of Paradise to whoever you meet outside this garden who testifies that there is no god but Allah while assuring of it in his heart.\u2019 The first one I met was Umar who asked, \u2018What are these sandals, O Abu Huraira?\u2019 I replied, \u2018They are the Prophet's ones. He gave them to me to give glad tidings of Paradise to whoever testifies that there is no god but Allah while assuring of it in his heart.\u2019 Thereupon, Omar struck me on the breast so I fell on my back. He then said, \u2018Go back, Abu Huraira.\u2019 I returned to the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) and started to weep. Omar followed me. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said, \u2018What is the matter, Abu Huraira?\u2019 I said, \u2018I met Omar and told him about what you said to me. He struck me on my breast so I fell on my back and he said to me, \u2018Go back.\u2019 The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said, \u2018O Omar, what did you do that?\u2019 He said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa), may my father and my mother be sacrificed to you, did you send Abu Huraira with your sandals to give glad tidings of Paradise to whoever he met who testifies that there is no god but Allah while assuring of it in his heart?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 Umar said, \u2018Do not do it, for I am afraid that people will stick to it alone. Let them do (good) deeds.\u2019 The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said, \u2018Well, let them.\u2019\u201d.", "commentary": "The grace of Allah upon His servants is great and His mercy encompasses all things. His mercy necessitates that whoever dies believing in monotheism will enter Paradise, so a Muslim should know its meaning in a way that contradicts ignorance, for it is the key to Paradise. In this hadith, Abu Hurairah narrated that the Companions were sitting around the Prophet (\ufdfa) with Abu Bakr, Umar, and others. The Prophet (\ufdfa) got up and left them. He was late to the extent that they were worried that he might be attacked by some of his enemies while they were not with him. The companions were alarmed and started to look for him. Abu Hurairah was the first to be alarmed and look for him. He came to a garden owned by some tribes of Medina. When he did not find its door, he entered through a hollow in the wall, through which a stream of water was running. After he entered, the Prophet (\ufdfa) gave him his shoes as a visible sign and asked him to give glad tidings of Paradise to whoever dying while certainly believing in Allah alone. A Muslim must firmly believe in this testimony without any type of doubt cast by devils or humans and act upon its required meaning. The Prophet (\ufdfa) mentioned the heart in this context to confirm the importance of sincerity in monotheism. Once came out, Abu Hurairah met Omar who asked him about the sandals so Abu Hurairah related to him the whole story. As a result, Omar hit Abu Hurairah\u2019s chest so he fell on his back. Omar did not want to hurt Abu Hurairah but he wanted to prevent him from reporting this hadith to people. He was afraid that people may have stuck to this testimony alone and neglected the rest of the Islamic rites. Both returned to the Prophet (\ufdfa) who asked Omar about what happened with Abu Hurairah. Omar told him the whole details and asked him about the authenticity of the report that Abu Hurairah   told him. Omar justified his reaction that he was afraid that people may have stuck to this testimony alone and neglected the rest of the Islamic rites. He proposed that Abu Hurairah would not inform people about this hadith, which the Prophet (\ufdfa) approved. As a matter of fact, the reward mentioned in that hadith would be applicable until the Day of Resurrection. This hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It clarifies the Companions\u2019 keenness and love for the Prophet (\ufdfa), (2) It shows how leaders have to care about their followers\u2019 rights and benefits and prevent what may harm them, (3) It is better to associate the important news with proof confirming it, (4) It mentions a great tiding to the people of monotheism, (5) A leader has to listen to his followers\u2019 arguments. If the follower has the right, the leader has to stick to his opinion. Otherwise, the leader has to clear up any misunderstanding that the follower may have, (6) It is evidence of Omar\u2019s firmness, wisdom, and understanding, (7) It shows the virtue of Abu Hurairah.."}, {"number": 12, "hadith": "Al-Abbas ibn Abdulmuttaleb narrated that he heard the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \"Whoever is pleased with Allah as a Lord, Islam as a religion, and Muhammad as a Prophet will taste the sweetness of faith.\".", "commentary": "Faith has wonderful secrets and sweetness tasted by hearts as we taste the sweetness of food and drink in our mouths. None will taste this sweetness except those whose hearts are full of it. When the heart is safe from deviating whims and misleading lusts, it feels the sweetness of faith. On the contrary, when it is sick with the previous diseases, it does not feel it and instead may taste the destructive whims and sins. In this hadith, the Prophet's saying, \u201cHe will taste the sweetness of faith,\u201d means he will feel its sweetness which is what the believer finds in terms of comfort and intimacy with knowing and loving Allah and his Messenger \ufdfa, knowing His blessing of choosing him a Muslim from the best Prophet's nation. His saying, \"Whoever is pleased with Allah as a Creator ...\" means he is convinced and satisfied with Allah as a Lord, Manager, Master, and God and pleased with his command while disbelieving in all what worshipped other than Him. His saying, \"... Islam as a religion ...\" means he is willingly satisfied with Islam as a method and doctrine while disbelieving in all other invalid religions. His saying, \"... Muhammad as a messenger ...\" means he is willingly satisfied with him as a leader and example in life and the revelation he received from Allah, obeys his commands, avoids his prohibitions, loves, and supports him. If a Muslim is pleased with these issues, all worldly issues become easier, for he deeply believes in Allah and truthfully surrenders to Allah and His legislation that the Prophet \ufdfa received and conveyed to him. As a result, his heart feels tranquillity, comfort, and sweetness of faith. Finally, this hadith urges us to completely believe in Allah, his Prophet \ufdfa, and His Book.."}, {"number": 13, "hadith": "Abu Huraira narrated, \"The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, 'Faith has seventy - or sixty - odd branches. The uppermost of which is the saying, ' La ilaha illah Allah' and the least is the removal of harmful objects from the road. Modesty is a branch of faith.'\".", "commentary": "Faith is branches and degrees divided into sayings, acts, and beliefs. All good attributes fall under it. Ahlusunnah wal Jamaah believes that a believer's faith increases by doing righteous deeds and avoiding sins. His faith decreases as much as he disobeys and commits sins. In this hadith, the Prophet \ufdfa confirmed that the complete faith consists of degrees that contain acts, and sayings of righteousness that reach seventy - or sixty - odd branches. Faith consists of (1) The heart's acts like believing in Allah's oneness, trust in Allah, fearing Allah, and hope of Allah's promise, (2) The tongue's acts like the two testimonies, remembering Allah, supplication, reciting the Quran, and others, and (3) The limbs' acts like prayer, fasting, relieving people, and supporting the oppressed. Whoever performs a righteous deed he completed a part of his faith. The Prophet confirmed that the faith's highest and best degrees, the foundation of faith, is the saying, \u201cThere is no god but Allah.\u201d Believing in Allah's oneness, his control of the whole universe, his only being worthy of worship, and acting upon that are the foundations of faith. This great testimony is (1) The word of piety, (2) The most trustworthy handhold, (3) The difference between disbelief and belief, (4) The word that Prophet Ibrahim made remain among his descendants that they may return to, and (5) The word on which heavens and Earth are established and for which all beings created, (6) It is the reason for creation, command, reward, and punishment, and (7) It is Allah's right upon all of His servants. It is neither intended to verbally say it while ignoring its meaning nor behaving like hypocrites, but it is intended to verbally say, believe it with heart, love its people, and hate what contradicts it. Then the Prophet \ufdfa explained that the least act of faith is to remove harmful things away from people's way like stones, thorns, etc. The Prophet also explained that modesty is one of faith's degrees. It is a moral that motivates one to leave evilness and prevents him from negligence. One's modesty with Allah means that He neither sees us where he prohibited nor loses us where He commanded us to be. In this sense, faith is the strongest motive for goodness and the greatest deterrent against evil. The Prophet mentioned modesty here, for it is a moral matter that our minds may forget that it is a faith's branch. This hadith refers that good morals are from faith. It collects all branches of faith which are beliefs, deeds, and morals, which all are complementary to faith. Moreover, this hadith generally mentioned all faith's branches, but they are detailed in the Prophet's Sunnah. Mentioning the number does not mean limiting it to sixty or seventy, but rather it indicates the abundance of faith's acts. Finally, the hadith clarifies the importance of modesty.."}, {"number": 14, "hadith": "Sufian ibn Abdullah Ath-Thaqafy said, \"I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, tell me something about Islam that I will not ask anyone after you.'\" In another narration, he said, \"... anyone but you.\" The Messenger \ufdfa said, \"Say, \u2018I believe in Allah\u2019 then keep to the straight path.\u201d.", "commentary": "Having a deep belief in Allah and seeking Islam's straight path as much as one can are the ways to success in this world and hereafter. The Prophet's companions were the keenest people asking him about what benefits them in these two stages. In this hadith, the companion Sufian ibn Abdullah Ath-Thaqafy asked the Prophet \ufdfa about an Islamic act that may save and suffice him away from other Islamic ones. He asked him about a comprehensive concept of all Islam's principles and objectives. This concept should guide and suffice him, complete his religion, and save him from Hell in the hereafter. The Prophet \ufdfa said to him, \u201cSay, \u2018I believe in Allah\u2019 then keep to the straight path.\u201d It means to certainly say \"I believe in Allah,\" and be upright while following the faith's guidance and requirements. Uprightness leads to all righteous deeds and prevents all evil acts. Thus, the hadith means being steadfast in faith with regularly performing righteous acts guiding us to the straight path. One of the uprightness' glad tidings is Allah's saying, \"Indeed, those who have said, 'Our Lord is Allah' and then remained on a right course - the angels will descend upon them, [saying], 'Do not fear and do not grieve but receive good tidings of Paradise, which you were promised.'\" (Fussilat: 30), and his saying, \"Indeed, those who have said, 'Our Lord is Allah,' and then remained on a right course - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve. Those are the companions of Paradise, abiding eternally therein as reward for what they used to do.\" (Al-Ahqaf: 13, 14)."}, {"number": 15, "hadith": "Abu Huraira narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \"He whose neighbor is not secure from his wrongful conduct will not enter Paradise.\".", "commentary": "The Islamic teachings recommend all that is good for people to preserve harmony among them. It commands us to be kind to our neighbors whether they are relatives or strangers, Muslim or non-Muslim. This hadith is one of the most decisive hadiths in which the Prophet \ufdfa mentioned the punishment for abusing our neighbors. His word, \"...his wrongful conduct.\" means oppression and transgression. In a dire threat, he confirms that a Muslim does not harm or hurt his neighbor, which will prevent him from entering Paradise. In the two Sahihs, Aisha narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \"Gabriel was recommending me about kindly and politely treating the neighbors so much so that I thought he would order me to make them as my heirs.\" His saying, \"He will not enter Paradise ...\" means that if he hurts his neighbor and dies while being a Muslim, he will not enter Paradise with the first groups, but he will be reckoned then enter Paradise due to his belief, except Allah forgives and pardons him. Finally, this hadith contains the following lessons: (1) It rebukes for harming neighbors, and (2) It confirms that misusing them is a way to be punished.."}, {"number": 16, "hadith": "Tareq ibn Shehab narrated, \u201cMarwan was the first one to deliver a sermon before the Eid prayer. A man stood up and said, \u2018Prayer should precede sermon.\u2019 He (Marwan) said, \u2018It has been done away with.\u2019 Abu Saeed remarked, \u2018This man has performed what he should do. I heard the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa saying, \u2018Whoever among you sees something abominable should modify it with his hand, if he is not able to do it, then (he should modify it) with his tongue, and if he is not able to do it, then (he should modify it) with his heart, which is the least level of faith.\u2019\u201d.", "commentary": "Allah honors and prefers the Muslim nation to other nations, for it enjoins goodness, forbids evil, and gently advises people, the qualities that transform any society into a virtuous one. This hadith related that the first person who delivered the Eid speech before performing the prayer was Marwan ibn Al-Hakam, the governor of Medina assigned by Caliph Muawiyah ibn Abi Sufian. He became the caliph in the year of 64 after Prophetic immigration. It was mistakenly narrated that the first person did that was Omar, Othman, Muawiyah, or Abdullah ibn Az-Zubeir. On the contrary, it was proven that the Prophet \ufdfa and his four Caliphs used to pray before delivering the Eid speech as Ibn Abbas narrated in the two Sahihs, \u201cI witnessed the Eid with the Messenger of Allah, Abu Bakr, Omar, and Othman. They all prayed before the speech.\" In the narration of Bukhari, Marwan mentioned why he did that. He said, \"People do not sit to listen to our speech after the prayer, so I delivered it before the prayer.\" Most of the people used to leave after the prayer and only some listened to Marwan's speech. He may have done that thinking that it was something in which he could follow his own opinion. Once he changed the Prophet's tradition, one of the attendees came and denounced his behavior. That person may have been Abu Masoud as in Imam Abderazzaq's narration but it was narrated in Sahih Bukhari that he was Abu Saeed himself, this hadith's narrator. Perhaps, this situation happened more than once and that every time Marwan was contradicted by someone. On the other hand, if it happened once, it would be possible that Abu Saeed first denounced Marwan's behavior, as in Bukhari's narration, then Abu Masoud. Marwan's response, \"It has been done away with\" may mean that: (1) People used to leave, for they were in a hurry, or (2) He left the proven tradition of praying before delivering the speech on purpose. Abu Saeed approved the man\u2019s denouncing Marwan and said, \"This man has performed what he should do.\" He denounced the evil with his tongue, for he could not change the ruler's behavior by his hands. Then Abu Saeed narrated the Prophet's hadith. The hadith states that if a person sees something evil and corrupting, he has to change it with his hand provided that his knowledge and ability. If he cannot change it with his hands, he has to wisely and kindly remind people about its prohibition. Changing the reality may be achieved by gentleness and wisdom away from swords. If he is unable to change it by word or tongue, he has to denounce it with his heart and resolve that if he were able to remove it, he would do it. Denouncing evil with one's heart is the lowest reaction that a believer has to bring, so the Prophet \ufdfa said as in Ibn Masoud's narration in Sahih Muslim, \"Beyond that, there is no faith even as the extent of a mustard seed.\" This hadith shows that there are two conditions of the obligation of enjoining the good and forbidding the evil: (1) Knowledge of whether that action is good or evil, for the ignorant person cannot determine that, and (2) The ability to do so, for it is enough for the unable person to hate the evil with his heart. Abu Saeed's comment confirmed that Marwarn was the first one to display that behavior, for if the Prophet \ufdfa or his companions showed that behavior, Abu Saeed would not call it evil as in his comment. Moreover, Abu Saeed held Marwan to prevent him from delivering the speech but the latter insisted on doing so. This hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It urges us to gradually enjoin the goodness and forbid the evil, each based on his ability, (2) It confirms the legitimacy of opposing rulers' behavior if they accept advice in public and this does not lead to another evil, (3) It clarifies that denouncing evil is a part of faith, (4) It shows that one's faith is subject to increase and decrease, (5) It stresses that Islam's rites cannot be changed or reordered. Once rulers try to do so, they have to be opposed as long as a person is able to do so and his denouncing will not lead to a greater evil.."}, {"number": 17, "hadith": "Abdullah ibn Masoud narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u201cAllah has not sent a prophet to a nation before me but he (a prophet) had disciples and companions following his way and obeying his command. Afterward, there came successors who said what they did not practice and practiced what they were not commanded to do. Whoever strove against them with his hand was a believer, whoever strove against them with his tongue was a believer, and whoever strove against them with his heart was a believer. There is no faith beyond that even to the extent of a mustard seed.\u201d Abu Rafi' said, \u201cI narrated this hadith to Abdullah ibn Umar but he disapproved of the narration. When Ibn Masoud came and stayed at Qanat, Abdullah ibn Umar asked me to accompany him to visit him (Ibn Masoud) during his illness. I went with him and asked Ibn Masoud about the Hadith when we sat (before him). He narrated it in the same as I narrated it to Ibn Umar.\u201d.", "commentary": "The Prophets' calls are of common features. All were resisted by some or lots of their people. All were followed by some of their people who afterward conveyed their calls. Over decades and centuries, people began to gradually move away from the truth. The one adhering to this truth had to resist them as much as he could. In this hadith, the Prophet \ufdfa confirmed that all Prophets that Allah had sent had disciples and companions following their ways and obeying their commands. Afterward, there came successors and hypocrites who said what they did not practice and practiced what they were not commanded to do while claiming and complimenting themselves on following their prophet's guidance. On the contrary, they were committing and spreading corruption. Every believer has to strive against those people based on his ability. Whoever strives against and tries to remove their evil with his hand or tongue is a believer. Moreover, whoever hates their evil with his heart is a believer, for he wishes he had been able to remove these evils with his hand or tongue but he was unable to do so. There is no faith beyond that even to the extent of a mustard seed, for if one does not hate the evil even if with his heart but pleases it, it is an approval of disbelief. This hadith shows that there are two conditions of the obligation of enjoining the good and forbidding the evil with hands or tongue: (1) Knowledge of whether that action is good or evil, for the ignorant person cannot determine that, and (2) The ability to do so, for it is enough for the unable person to hate the evil with his heart. Striving against evils by one's hands is only for those being able to change them without a conflict such as those in charge and rulers. Striving against evils by one\u2019s tongue is by showing and calling for the truth. Striving against evils by one's heart is by rejecting, hating, and displeasing them. Abu Rafi' said, \u201cI narrated this hadith to Abdullah ibn Omar but he disapproved of the narration.\u201d Ibn Omar\u2019s disapproval may be interpreted that he wanted to check the authenticity of the hadith, for one may unwillingly increase, decrease, or even distort his own narrations. He did not mean to accuse Abu Rafi\u2019, for all people were vulnerable to forget. Ibn Omar knew that Abu Rafi\u2019 was a great companion with a high level of justice and honesty. When Ibn Masoud came to Medina, Ibn Omar commanded Abu Rafi\u2019 to go with him to visit Ibn Masoud. When they sat with him, Abu Rafi\u2019 asked Ibn Masoud about this hadith, so Ibn Masoud narrated it to him just as Abu Rafi\u2019 had narrated it to Ibn Omar. Abu Rafi\u2019 did that to make sure of the hadith context and defend his narration. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It includes one of the signs of the Prophet\u2019s prophethood, (2) It stresses the necessity of enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, according to people\u2019s conditions, (3) It clarifies the virtue of the Prophet\u2019s companions, for they presented his properties and selves for the sake of this religion, (4) It shows that changing the evil is part of the Islamic faith, and (5) It refers that one\u2019s faith increases and decreases.."}, {"number": 18, "hadith": "Jaber ibn Abdullah narrated, \u201cThe Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u2018Hearts\u2019 callousness and sternness is in the East while faith is among the people of the Hijaz.\u2019\u201d.", "commentary": "People vary in faith, piety, behavior, and even the degrees of their evil acts. The Prophet used to teach us people's various attributes so that we can deal with them in the proper way they deserve. In this hadith, he informed us that we find people of hard hearts, lack of understanding, and refusing the truth due to disbelief in the East. A narration in the two Sahihs reported by Abu Masoud Uqbah ibn Amr clarified that they are the people of Rabi\u2019a and Mudar. This was during the era of the Prophet \ufdfa. They were hard people due to the harsh conditions they were living in. It was said that he may have meant all areas of the East: Middle, Near, and Far. After the Prophet's death, these two tribes had many trials such as: (1) Many people disbelieved once again, and (2) Some claimed prophethood as Museilemah, the Liar. The Prophet meant that they were subject to obey the devil and disbelieve the Islamic message. On the other hand, he informed us that we find deep faith, tranquillity, and comfort in the people of Hijaz, i.e. Mecca, Medina, and their environs. It is called \"hijaz,\" for some potential reasons: (1) It separates Najd from Sara, (2) It separates Ghaur from Levant, or (3) It is surrounded by mountains. Finally, this hadith confirms the virtue of the people of Hijaz over other people.."}, {"number": 19, "hadith": "Abu Hurairah narrated, \u201cThe Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u2018You will not enter Paradise until you believe and you will not believe until you love one another. May I tell you something you can do to make you love one another? Spread the greetings of salam (peace) among you.\u2019\u201d.", "commentary": "The Prophet \ufdfa used to teach his companions and nation the virtues of righteous deeds that display a feeling of affection among them and raise their ranks in the Hereafter. He also warned us against reasons for hatred and disharmony. Spreading the greetings of peace is one of the causes of love and harmony among Muslims. In this hadith, the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa clarified that only believers will enter Paradise and added that love among believers is part of the perfect faith. He said, \"You will not enter Paradise until you believe.\" He means that our faith is neither complete nor benefits us until we love one another. Then he guides us to the best attributes for getting that kind of love in Muslim society which is to declare, act upon, and spread peace among Muslims. Peace is the greeting that Allah, the Almighty, has prescribed for His servants. Once a Muslim passes by another Muslim, relative or stranger, he greets him with peace. Allah made spreading peace a reason for love and affection among Muslims, which is a reason for getting a perfect faith and prevailing the word of Islam. On the other hand, hatred and conflict are reasons for spreading division among Muslims. The form of that greeting as in the narration of Abu Daoud and others is to say, \u201cPeace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.\u201d Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits such as: (1) The command to spread the greeting of peace among Muslims, for it spreads love and safety among them and (2) It is proof that love is a reason for the perfect faith.."}, {"number": 20, "hadith": "Tamim Ad-Dary narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \"Religion is sincerity.\" They said, \"To whom?\" He said, \"To Allah, to his Book, to his Messenger, to the leaders of Muslims and their common folk.\".", "commentary": "Sincere advice is one of the features of our true religion. Muslims should advise each other in a good manner, and without making a greater evil than the benefit they want to achieve. This should be with loving and knowing the rights of the one who is advised in the society for his being a Muslim. This hadith clarifies the methods of this supreme behavior. The Prophet \ufdfa clarified that sincere advice is Islam's essence and a means for its spreading. It is to say or do something that contains goodness for a person(s) sincerely. It is to seek goodness for the one who is advised. Moreover, it is a comprehensive term with various meanings. The Prophet's companions asked him to whom they offer it, so he answered, \"To Allah, to his Book, to his Messenger, to the leaders of Muslims and their common folk.\" As for one's dealing with Allah, it means glorifying His command, showing mercy on His creation, calling people to believe in Him, and avoiding any acts of polytheism while worshiping him only. As for one's dealing with the Quran, it means to believe that it is Allah's word, deeply love and glorify it, recite it as it should be recited, face those distorting its authentic interpretations, ratify its stories, ponder over its lessons and miracles, act upon its rules, spread its knowledge, and call people to believe in it. As for one's dealing with the Messenger, it means to believe, follow, obey his commands, and avoid what he forbade. Moreover, it means to be loyal to those who are loyal to him and hate those who hate him. In addition, it means glorifying him, spreading his teachings, and facing people's accusations against him. As for one's dealing with leaders of Muslims, it means helping them in what is right, obeying them in goodness, gently reminding them if they neglect something, and avoiding disobeying them unless we see them doing an act of clear disbelief that Allah obviously showed in his religion, which is conditional on ability and avoiding having greater harms. The Muslim's leaders may include the scholars as well. As for one's dealing with Muslim scholars, it means accepting what they narrated and thinking well of them. As for one's dealing with common Muslim folk, it means gently teaching them Islam's laws, providing them with what is beneficial, having mercy on them, respecting them, avoiding cheating or envying them, loving for them what one loves for himself, hating for them what one hates for himself, and defending their properties and honor. Finally, this hadith contains the following lessons: (1) It confirms that advising people is the essence of Islam, and (2) It urges people to advise all people types, from the ruler to lay people.."}, {"number": 21, "hadith": "Abu Hurairah narrated, \"The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, 'There are three signs of a hypocrite ... even if he fasted, prayed, and claimed he is a Muslim.'\".", "commentary": "Hypocrisy has two types: (1) Doctrinal: It expels the person from Islam, for he shows Islam and conceals disbelief and (2) Practical: It does not expel the person from Islam, for he just imitates the hypocrites in their morals, which is a major sin. This hadith identifies some attributes of hypocrites by clarifying the second type of hypocrisy. This hadith is part of another hadith in which the Prophet \ufdfa informed that a hypocrite has three signs: (1) He used to tell lies and fabricate unrealistic stories. Lying is to say something contrary to reality. Its greatest form is to lie to Allah, the Almighty, and His Messenger \ufdfa. It also includes lying in one's acts, so the hypocrite is a liar, for he shows faith but conceals disbelief inwardly. The Prophet \ufdfa indicated that lying sometimes is permissible for some overriding interests. Bukhari and Muslim narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \u201cHe is not a liar who reconciles between people, so he conveys or says goodness.\u201d Islam urges us to reconcile between people even if it is achieved by lying to settle quarrels and avoid feelings of hatred and enmity, (2) He used to break his promises willingly, and (3) He used to betray people's trust. He loses, betrays, and uses their trust. The Prophet \ufdfa informed that whoever used to act upon these three attributes is a hypocrite even if he performs the practical acts of worship such as prayer, fasting, etc. This hadith clarifies that these qualities belong to hypocrites so whoever behaves like that resembles hypocrites. It does not mean he is a hypocrite who shows Islam and conceals disbelief, for the Prophet \ufdfa did not mean that he is a hypocrite who will be eternally in the lowest degree of Hell.."}, {"number": 22, "hadith": "Jarir narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \"If any slave escapes from his masters, he becomes an infidel till he returns to them.\u201d.", "commentary": "Islam regulated the relations between masters and slaves. It called for kindly treating slaves and urged masters to emancipate them. It also encouraged slaves to care for Allah's and their masters' rights, for their masters bought them so it does not make sense that their properties may be wasted. Islam makes obeying masters, for the sake of Allah, is one of the greatest acts of worship. In this hadith, Jarir ibn Abdullah narrated that if any slave flees from his masters, he is a disbeliever. It may mean that he denies his master's rights or behaves like disbelievers do. It may also mean that his behavior leads to disbelief. It does not mean the literal meaning of disbelief. It means that he disbelieves Allah's graces by fleeing from his master until he returns to him willingly or unwillingly. Allah neither pleases him nor accepts his righteous deeds until his return, repentance, and righteousness. The complete narration of this hadith is that Mansour ibn Abdurrahman (the hadith narrator on the authority of Amer Ash-Sha\u2019by) said after his narration, \"By Allah, it is a Prophetic hadith, but I hate that it may be narrated on my authority here in Basra.\u201d This means that Mansour traced back this hadith to the companion but he then swore that it was the Prophet's hadith to let his knowledgeable companions know about that. He feared that his transmitted narration to the Prophet may have spread in Basra which was full of Kharijites and Mutazilites who believed that one would eternally remain in Hell due to his sins. The former added that he is a disbeliever, depending on the apparent meaning of this hadith. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) The slave\u2019s fleeing from his masters is a major sin that contradicts the faith's requirements of obeying them and (2) Muslim predecessors cautioned against the wrong concepts that people of heresies may deduce from the Islamic texts that may apparently support their heresies.."}, {"number": 23, "hadith": "Jarir ibn Abdullah narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \"If a slave escapes (from his master), not a single prayer will be accepted from him.\u201d.", "commentary": "The slave\u2019s obedience to his master according to the obedience of Allah, the Almighty, is one of the greatest acts of worship. Allah organized the relations between masters and slaves. He urged masters to gently deal with them and recommended them to set them free. On the other hand, he encouraged slaves to preserve Allah's and their masters' rights. A master buys his slave with his money, so he has the right not to waste his money. In this hadith, the Prophet \ufdfa confirmed that if a slave escapes from his master, \"not a single prayer will be accepted from him.\u201d This is because the slave is completely owned by his master so if he escapes, his master misses some benefits. It was said that the hadeeth refers to a slave who considers escaping lawful so he becomes a disbeliever and neither his prayer nor any other acts of worship are accepted from him. The Prophet \ufdfa exclusively mentioned prayer for its greatness and virtue. It was said that the hadeeth is general and that rejecting his worship does not necessitate its invalidity. The escaped slave's prayer (who does not think that escaping is lawful) is correct, for he fulfils its pillars, but it is still unaccepted because it is associated with disobeying his master. There is no contradiction in that, for rejecting his worship means losing the reward but its validity means he is neither required to re-perform it nor he may be punished as the one used to abandon the prayer. Finally, this hadith confirms that a slave's escaping from his master is a great sin which contradicts faith's requirements commanding him to obey his master.."}, {"number": 24, "hadith": "Abu Huraira narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \"A person who believes in Allah and the Last Day never bears a grudge against the Ansar.\".", "commentary": "The Ansar, the people of Medina from the Prophet's companions before his immigration, reached a high rank in Islam for their great effort in supporting Islam, sheltering the Messenger and his immigrant companions, loving him, and his love for them. They used to present all that they had for him to the extent that lots of people became their enemies due to Islam. As a result, the Prophet \ufdfa urged all Muslims to love them. Moreover, he made loving them a sign of one's truthful and perfect faith and hating them is a sign of one's hypocrisy and lack of faith. In this hadith, the Prophet \ufdfa informed that a person who believes in Allah and the Last Day never bears a grudge against the Ansar, for whoever knows their right, initiative to support and spread Islam, and fighting against all people in defending the prophet will definitely love them out of necessity, which is a sign of his sincere faith. On the other hand, if one hates them, it is a sign of hypocrisy and corrupted intention. Because these great people with those supreme attributes are loved by only believers and hated by only hypocrites. Whoever loves them is loved by Allah and whoever hates them is hated by Allah as in the hadith narrated in the two Sahihs. Finally, this hadith contains some lessons: (1) It shows the Ansar\u2019s virtues, (2) It confirms that loving them is a sign of one's sincere faith while hating them is a sign of corruption or lack of faith, and (3) It calls every Muslim to give Medina's people their rights.."}, {"number": 25, "hadith": "Ali said, \"By Him Who split up the seed and created something living, it is the illiterate Prophet's promise \ufdfa that he gave me that none but a believer would love me and none but a hypocrite would bear grudge against me.\".", "commentary": "Ali ibn Abi Taleb had great status with the Prophet \ufdfa for the following reasons: (1) His father, Abu Taleb, used to support and defend the Prophet against Qureish disbelievers, (2) He is the husband of Fatema, the Prophet's daughter, his most beloved daughters, and (3) The father of Prophet's grandsons, Al-Hasan and Al-Husein. In this hadith, Ali swore in Allah Who split up the seed, placed it in the soil, and created the plant by His power. He swore in Allah Who created the men and souls. His saying, \"It is the Prophet's promise ...\" means a covenant. His saying, \"illiterate ...\" is the attribute with which the Prophet was described in the previous books and in two places in the Quran: (1) \"Those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered prophet, whom they find written in what they have of the Torah and the Gospel.\" {Al-A'raaf: 157) and (2) \"So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered prophet, who believes in Allah and His words.\" {Al-A'raaf: 158) It was the Prophet's promise to Ali that he had a virtue that all believers would love him, but hypocrites would hate him. It means that if one loves and knows Ali's prestige, his closeness to the Prophet, the Prophet's love for him, and his support of Islam, it is proof of his authentic faith and truthfulness as he is doing what Allah and his Prophet please. On the contrary, if one hates him, it is proof of his hypocrisy and evil intention. It is an additional recommendation for Ali, for the Prophet \ufdfa recommended us to care about his companions and follow their methods. Also, he guided us to give a high prestige to his rightly guided caliphs, including Ali. It is neither proof of Ali's specific guardianship, nor his caliphate after the Prophet's death. It may have been the Prophet's appreciation for Alai and call for Muslims to give him his considerable prestige and avoid belittling him after the Prophet's death. On the other hand, it was a sign of prophethood, for the Prophet knew that some people would go to extremes when dealing with Ali after the Prophet's death whether they would love him exaggeratedly or belittle him. As a result, he confirmed the believers' hearts would love Ali and the hypocrites' hearts would hate him.."}, {"number": 26, "hadith": "Abdullah ibn Omar narrated, \u201cThe Messenger of Allah said, \u201cO Women, give charity and frequently ask Allah for forgiveness, for I saw you form the majority of Hell.\u201d A wise woman from them asked, \u201cO Messenger of Allah, why will we form the majority of Hell?\u201d He answered, \u201cYou frequently curse and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen someone lacking in discernment and religion more overwhelming a wise man than you.\u201d She asked, \u201cWhat is the lack of discernment and religion?\u201d He answered, \u201cAs for the lack of discernment, the testimony of two women is equal to a man\u2019s one. She does not pray for some days and breaks fast in the month of Ramadan. This is the lack of religion.\u201d.", "commentary": "The Prophet \ufdfa used to preach to women just as he did to men, ask them to protect themselves against evilness, and frequently remind them of rectify their faults. In this hadith, Abdullah ibn Omar narrated that after the Prophet \ufdfa delivered his speech on the day of eid, he preached to women only, as in the narration in the Two Sahihs that Abu Saeed Al-Khudry reported that the Prophet \ufdfa commanded them to give charity and ask Allah for forgiveness. He justified this matter by the fact that he knew that most of the people of Hell were women. Giving charity is a means to increase good deeds and avoid Allah's anger and punishment. When hearing so, a wise woman asked about the reason. He showed two reasons: (1) They used to frequently curse those who did not deserve it. Cursing is to supplicate Allah to expel someone from his mercy, which was a habit of women before Islam and (2) They used to be ungrateful to their husbands. He explained it in another narration in the Two Sahihs when he addressed men, \"If you treated one of them kindly forever, but she later saw something (disliked) from you, she would say, 'I never saw any good from you.'\" She may be ungrateful to her husband while he treats her kindly. This continuous deliberate behavior enlarges this sin to be a major one. His help, protection, sacrifice, and care should be met with her gratitude and appreciation. Allah commands us to thank whoever gives us a favor. How is it the case with a woman's husband who gives her all that he owns throughout his entire life?! Then, he \ufdfa described them with three attributes: (1) A woman has the ability to affect her wise husband's decision whether it is right or wrong. What about the unwise husband? (2) A lack of discernment: This is because a man's testimony is equivalent to two women's testimony. Allah said, \"... so that if one of them (two women) errs, the other can remind her.\" (Al-Baqarah: 282), (3) A lack of religion: This is because she does not pray for some days and breaks fast in the month of Ramadan due to her menstruation. The Prophet \ufdfa did not mean to blame them for these attributes with which Allah created them but wanted to warn men against the tricks that women sometimes use. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) A person has the right to discuss the scholar and others if he does not understand his words, (2) Encouragement of charity acts, frequent seeking of Allah\u2019s forgiveness, and all other acts of obedience, (3) One's righteous deeds eliminate his evil deeds, (4) Some Islamic texts may call something disbelief but do not mean the disbelief in Allah such as disbelief in marital life, benevolence, grace, and truth.."}, {"number": 27, "hadith": "Abu Hurairah narrated, \u201cThe Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u2018When a son of Adam recites a verse mentioning prostration then he prostrates, the devil withdraws weeping and saying, \u2018Woe to him! - in another narration, \u2018Woe to me!\u2019 - The son of Adam has been commanded to prostrate, has done so, and will be rewarded with Paradise but I have been commanded to prostrate, have refused, and will be punished with Hell.\u2019 In another narration, \u2018 \u2026 have disobeyed, and will be punished with Hell.\u2019\u201d.", "commentary": "There are Quranic verses that one is prescribed to prostrate after reciting them, which the Prophet's noble tradition specified. It is an act of worship and a reward for those who prostrate. In this hadith, the Prophet \ufdfa informed that when a Muslim prostrates after reciting this type of verse, the devil withdraws weeping due to the reward that a Muslim gets for his obedience and prostration. He is crying and saying, \"Woe to him!\" In another narration, \"Woe to me!\" It means, \"Oh, my sorrow, oh my doom.\" He regrets his previous disobedience to Allah. The son of Adam has been commanded to prostrate, has done so, and will be rewarded with Paradise due to his obedience. On the other hand, Satan has been commanded to prostrate but has refused. In another narration, \"I have disobeyed, and will be punished with Hell.\" He deserved to enter Hell for disobeying Allah's command. Allah says, \"And [mention] when We said to the angels, 'Prostrate before Adam;' so they prostrated, except for Iblees. He refused and was arrogant ...\" (Al-Baqarah: 34) He is deeply sad for some reasons: (1) His failure in luring the son of Adam to commit sins, (2) His committing a fatal sin of being arrogant to Allah's command, and (3) Muslim's being deserved to enter Paradise for his obedience, while Satan is condemned to be expelled from Allah\u2019s mercy. Blessed are those believers whose hearts become fearful when Allah is mentioned, their faith increases when Allah's verses are recited to them, and those who trust in their God. As for what a Muslim can say during this prostration, he can say the same supplications he says during the prostration of prayer, such as glorification. Finally, this hadith contains the following lessons: (1) The virtue of prostration which is a reason for entering Paradise and (2) A Quran reciter is permissible to prostrate after reciting a verse of prostration.."}, {"number": 28, "hadith": "Gaber said, \"I heard the Prophet \ufdfa saying, 'Verily, between a man and polytheism and unbelief is the abandonment of prayer.'\".", "commentary": "Prayer is an obligatory act for every assigned Muslim. It is the second pillar of Islam and the greatest practical pillar after monotheism testimony. In this hadith, the Messenger \ufdfa strongly warned against abandoning it and confirmed that between a man and polytheism is to abandon prayer. If he abandons it out of denial of its obligation, he is unanimously a disbeliever but if he abandons it out of negligence or laziness, he is a disbeliever according to the opinion of many scholars and the consensus of the Prophet's companions. If he sometimes performs and neglects it, he is also included in the description mentioned in the hadith, which is consistent with Allah's sayings, \"But there came after them successors who neglected prayer and pursued desires; so they are going to meet evil. Except those who repent, believe and do righteousness; for those will enter Paradise and will not be wronged at all.\" (Maryam: 59, 60) In this verse, Allah condemned those neglecting prayer either abandoning it completely, abandoning some of its pillars and conditions, neglecting its duties, or performing it after its appointed times, etc. He condemned those being busy with their own whims and desires and preferring them to Allah's obedience and Paradise. Thus, he deserves to be punished except those who rectify their mistakes, struggle in the path of truth, regularly perform prayer, refrain from following their whims. They will enter Paradise and be saved from Hell. One has to caution against abandoning or neglecting this great worship. On the other hand, polytheism and disbelief may be used in the same sense, which is disbelief in Allah, the Almighty. There may be a distinction between them, so polytheism is specific to worshipping idols while acknowledging Allah, the Creator, like the infidels of Qureish. In this meaning, disbelief is more general than polytheism. Finally, this hadith deeply warns against abandoning or neglecting prayer.."}, {"number": 29, "hadith": "Abdullah narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \"None will enter Hell as long as he has the weight of a mustard seed of faith in his heart and none will enter Paradise as long as he has the weight of a mustard seed of arrogance in his heart.\u201d.", "commentary": "Faith is a reason for salvation from Hell and winning Paradise while arrogance is an attribute that refers to corrupted hearts and a reason for entering Hell. In this hadith, the Prophet \ufdfa informed that a Muslim will neither enter Hell nor even remain there forever if his heart has the weight of a mustard seed of faith. Mustard is a plant with very small black fruits. It is a linguistic usage referring to smallness. It is Allah's great blessing that he will save the believers for their faith, even if He holds them accountable for their deeds first and admits them to Paradise by His grace and mercy. Afterward, the Prophet informed that a Muslim will not enter Paradise if his heart has the weight of a mustard seed of arrogance. Arrogance is to give oneself a high prestige that it does not deserve and belittle people. Allah is the only one that deserves this attribute. Mentioning the infinitesimal mustard seed indicates that even the slightest amount of arrogance in a Muslim's heart is a reason for not initially entering Paradise until he is held accountable for this arrogance which may necessitate punishment. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It is proof that faith increases and decreases in hearts and (2) It forbids arrogance.."}, {"number": 30, "hadith": "Abdullah narrated, \"The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, 'He who has in his heart the weight of a mustard seed of arrogance will not enter Paradise.' A man said, 'Verily, a person loves that his dress should be fine and his shoes should be fine.' The Prophet said, 'Verily, Allah is beautiful and likes beauty. Arrogance is to reject the truth and despise people.'\".", "commentary": "Arrogance is an attribute that indicates the corruption of hearts, which Islam forbade because it means self-aggrandizement while despising others. It is only Allah who deserves to be proud, for everyone else is His servant. In this hadith, the Prophet \ufdfa explained the severe consequences of arrogance and dispelled some people\u2019s misconceptions related to good appearance. He told us that Allah would not admit anyone to Paradise if his heart had the weight of an atom (or dust particle) of arrogance. This indicates that even the slightest bit of arrogance in one's heart is a reason for not initially entering Paradise. He should be reckoned first then will be punished or forgiven. One of the Prophet's companions thought that arrogance includes beautifying one\u2019s clothing and appearance. So, he asked the Prophet \ufdfa if a person loves that his clothes should be fine, is this considered arrogance? The Prophet \ufdfa replied, \"Verily, Allah is beautiful and likes beauty.\" He confirmed that Allah loved this manner as long as it did not lead to despising people. One's caring for his appearance is an indication of Allah's blessings upon him. Then the Prophet \ufdfa clarified that the intended meaning of arrogance is to reject the truth and look down on people. So, this bad manner leads to oppress and disdain people. As a result, he will not initially enter Paradise but be punished for this great sin. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It is forbidden to be arrogant and reject the truth, (2) Islam allows beautifying oneself by wearing beautiful clothes and shoes, (3) It proves that the name \u201cthe Beautiful\u201d is one of Allah's names.."}, {"number": 31, "hadith": "Gaber said, \"A man came to the Prophet \ufdfa and said, 'O Messenger of Allah, what are the two things quite unavoidable?' He replied, 'He who dies without associating anything with Allah will enter Paradise and he who dies associating anything with Allah will enter Hell.'\".", "commentary": "The Prophet's companions used to ask him about matters of religion. They were the most afraid people of Allah although they hoped for his mercy. In this hadith, Jaber ibn Abdullah narrated that a man came and asked the Prophet \ufdfa about a desirable attribute that definitely leads us to enter Paradise and an evil attribute that definitely leads us to enter Hell. The Prophet \ufdfa said that dying while believing in Allah is the first attribute. In this case, even if one committed sins, Allah would either forgive him without reckoning or hold him accountable for his sins then he would enter Paradise. In Bukhari and Muslim, Abu Dharr narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \"If anyone says, 'There is no god but Allah' then dies, he will enter paradise.' I asked, 'Even if he committed fornication or stealing?' The Prophet \ufdfa replied, 'Even if he committed fornication or stealing.' I repeated, 'Even if he committed fornication or stealing?' The Prophet \ufdfa replied, 'Even if he committed fornication or stealing' thrice. Then the Prophet \ufdfa answered in the fourth time, 'Even if he committed fornication or stealing in spite of Abu Dharr\u2019s will.'\" By the way, this reward does not include the hypocrites. On the other hand, the Prophet showed that dying while associating partners with Allah is the second attribute, for it is a major polytheism. As a result, Hell will be his eternal abode. Polytheism is to associate others with Allah's divinity or worship. Finally, this hadith includes the following benefits: (1) It shows the virtue of believing and worshipping Allah alone and (2) It warns against polytheism and clarifies its terrible danger.."}, {"number": 32, "hadith": "Safwan ibn Muhriz narrated that Jundab ibn Abdullah Al-Bajaly sent a message to 'As'as ibn Salama during the stormy days of Ibn Az-Zubair saying, \"Gather some men from your family so I can talk to them.\" 'As'as sent a messenger to them. When they assembled, Jundab came wearing a yellow hooded cloak and said, \"Complete the talks you had.\" When they fell into conversation then it was his turn to speak, he took the hood off his head and said, \"I came to you to narrate a hadith of your Prophet \ufdfa. He sent a squad of the Muslims to a tribe of the polytheists. When they confronted one another, there was a man among the army of polytheists whenever he intended to kill a man from among the Muslims, he killed him. There was a man among the Muslims who looked forward to (an opportunity of) his (the polytheist's) inattention. We talked that he was Osama ibn Zaid. When he raised his sword (to kill the polytheist), he uttered, \u201cThere is no god but Allah,\u201d but he (Osama) killed him. When the messenger of the glad tidings came to the Prophet \ufdfa, he asked him (about the events of the battle) so he informed him about that. He also told him about the man (Osama) and what he had done. The Prophet \ufdfa called and asked the man, \u201cWhy did you kill him?\u201d He (Osama) answered, \u201cO Messenger of Allah \ufdfa, he forcibly struck the Muslims and killed such and such.\u201d He named some of them and added, \u201cI attacked him, but when he saw the sword, he said, \u2018There is no god but Allah.\u2019\u201d The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u201cDid you kill him?\u201d Osama said, \u201cYes.\u201d The Prophet \ufdfa added, \u201cWhat would you do with \u2018There is no god but Allah\u2019 when it came on the Day of Judgment?\u201d Osama said, \u201cO Messenger of Allah \ufdfa, seek forgiveness for me (from Allah).\u201d The Prophet \ufdfa answered, \u201cWhat would you do with \u2018There is no god but Allah\u2019 when it came on the Day of Judgment?\u201d He still repeated to him, \u201cWhat would you do with \u2018There is no god but Allah\u2019 when it came on the Day of Judgment?\u201d.", "commentary": "Islam is keen to protect people's lives and blood and prevent them from attacking one another, so the testimony of monotheism means embracing Islam and preserving one\u2019s blood, property, and honor. In this hadith, Safwan ibn Muhriz narrated that the Prophet\u2019s companion Jundab ibn Abdullah Al-Bajaly sent a message to \u2018As\u2019as ibn Salama during the stormy days of Ibn Az-Zubair who fought the Umayyad caliph in 64th AH. Safwan asked \u2018As\u2018as to gather some of his tribe. When they came, they started talking to each other until Jundab entered. Upon entering, he said to them, \u201cComplete the talks you had.\u201d They talked one by one. It was said that he guided them to speak lest they felt lonely or shameful about his presence. When it was his turn to speak, he took the hood off his head and said, \u201cI came to you to narrate a hadith of your Prophet \ufdfa.\u201d He told them that the Prophet \ufdfa sent a squad to a polytheist tribe called \u201cAl-Huraqah\u201d as Osama in Zaid narrated in the Two Sahihs. When the two armies confronted one another, there was a skilful polytheist that he killed any Muslim he was fighting. As a result, the companions mentioned that Osama ibn Zaid was waiting for the polytheist's inattention. When Osama surrounded and raised the sword before the polytheist, the latter declared the testimony of monotheism, but Osama killed him, thinking he said that out of fear. One of the Muslims informed the Prophet \ufdfa about the Muslims\u2019 victory and Osama\u2019s behavior. The Prophet \ufdfa called and asked Osama about the reason of his killing that man. Osama confirmed that the polytheist strongly fought Muslims and killed some of them. He mentioned some companions the polytheists killed. Once Osama raised his sword before him, the polytheist was certain of being killed, so he declared the testimony of monotheism to protect himself. Osama said in another narration of Imam Muslim, \u201cHe only said it out of fear of the weapon,\u201d but the Prophet \ufdfa said to him, \u201cDid you split his heart to know whether he said it or not?\u201d The Prophet \ufdfa refused killing him after uttering the testimony of monotheism and repeated scolding Osama, \u201cWhat would you do with \u2018There is no god but Allah\u2019 when it came on the Day of Judgment?\u201d He meant who would intercede and defend you when facing the word of monotheism on that day or how you killed him after his being protected by Islam. Osama asked the Prophet \ufdfa to ask Allah\u2019s forgiveness for him, but he did nothing more than saying, \u201cWhat would you do with \u2018There is no god but Allah\u2019 when it came on the Day of Judgment?\u201d Although it was well known that Osama was one of the most beloved ones to the Prophet \ufdfa, but he refused to ask Allah\u2019s forgiveness for him. He may have done so out of scolding him and intimidating others. In Bukhari\u2019s narration, Osama said, \u201cThe Prophet \ufdfa kept on repeating so till I wished I had not been a Muslim before that day,\u201d for Islam erased all sins committed before one\u2019s embracing it. Osama looked down upon all righteous deeds he did before in comparison to this deed due to the Prophet\u2019s strong refusal. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) The role of leaders, scholars, and celebrities that they try their best to guide, preach, and comfort people during stormy times, (2) A Muslim deals with people based on their apparent behaviors while entrusting their hidden matters to Allah, (3) People of monotheism\u2019s blood is sacred, (4) The legitimacy of blaming, rebuking, and exaggerating in preaching about important matters, and (5) The leader scolds the wrongdoer, regardless of his position.."}, {"number": 33, "hadith": "Abu Huraira narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa once passed by a pile of food. When he put his hand into it, his fingers felt some dampness so he asked, \u201cWhat is this, O owner of the food?\" He answered, \u201cIt was the rain, O Messenger of Allah.\u201d He said, \u201cWhy did you not put it on the top so that people can see it? He who deceives is not from us.\".", "commentary": "Honesty is one of the supreme morals that transactions require to avoid disputes in societies. On the contrary, cheating and deception lead to hatred and quarrels among people. This hadith clarifies that cheating is not from Islam and the cheater is in great danger. Abu Huraira narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa passed by a man who is selling a pile of food such as wheat or barley. When he entered his hand into it, he felt some dampness underneath. In the narration of Abu Dawud, Abu Huraira reported, \"The Messenger of Allah  \ufdfa passed a man who was selling food. He asked him, 'What are you selling?' He informed him. It was revealed to him, 'Put your hand into it.' Thus, he put his hand into it and felt that it was damp.\" When the Prophet asked, \"What is this, O owner of the food?\" The merchant answered that it was due to the rain. This meant that he put the dry and clean food on the top while putting the wet and bad one at the bottom. The Prophet \ufdfa accepted his excuse, alerted him to do the right act and said, \u201cWhy did you not put it on the top so that people can see it?\" Thus, they could easily know the case of the food, especially they used to sell piles without examining them. The Prophet considered this act as deceitful and said, \"He who deceives is not from us.\" He means he is away from the Prophet's method and teachings. This is a severe rebuke and threat from the Prophet \ufdfa to those persisting in deception. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It prohibits deception in all matters, especially in transactions, (2) It stresses the necessity of clarifying products' defects to buyers, (3) It confirms that a ruler has to check people's cases and advise those needing it, and (4) It shows how the Islamic law is keen to keep Muslims away from anything that may harm them.."}, {"number": 34, "hadith": "Abu Dharr narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \u201cThere are three (types) with whom Allah will not speak on the Day of Resurrection: The bestower who does not give anything to anyone but he reminds him of it, the one who sells his product by taking a false oath, and the one who lets down his lower garment (below his ankles).\u201d In another narration, \u201cThere are three (types) that Allah will neither speak, look, nor purify them and they will have a painful torment.\u201d.", "commentary": "The Prophet \ufdfa used to warn his companions against inferior qualities and unacceptable deeds. He was very keen to guide them to all that making them closer to Paradise. In this hadith, he told us about three types of people to whom Allah would not pleasingly speak on the Day of Resurrection to belittle and punish them. In another narration, he said that Allah would not look at them. This means He would neither mercifully look at them nor purify them from their sins and vileness. Above all, they would get a severe punishment. They are as follows: (1) The one who used to proudly remind the poor of the gifts he sent them whether in words or acts. He used to remind them of favors they owed him. Undoubtedly, all of these prohibited acts negate the charity he provided. These forbidden acts include arrogance, enslaving and humiliating the poor, and breaking their hearts. On the contrary, the spender should belong these favors to Allah, the real Giver, and be sure that He will grant him multiple rewards for what he provided. Thus, how does he harm or even remind the needy about his gifts?!, (2) The one who used to deceive and falsely swear to promote his goods. He committed four sins: (a) False swearing, deceiving Muslims, unlawfully taking people's properties, and belittling Allah's rights. Allah said, \"Indeed, those who exchange the covenant of Allah and their [own] oaths for a small price will have no share in the Hereafter, and Allah will not speak to them or look at them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them; and they will have a painful punishment.\" (Aal-Imran: 77), (3) The one who used to lengthen and arrogantly trail his clothes on the ground. In the narration of the two Sahihs, Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \u201cOn the Day of Resurrection, Allah will not look at him who trails his lower garment out of pride.\" It was said that the Prophet \ufdfa combined these three types because all of them exalt themselves while despising and belittling people out of pride and arrogance. As a result, Allah would despise and ignore them. His mentioning these three types does not mean exclusiveness, for he mentioned some other types that will get that punishment such as the adulterous old man, the lying king, and the arrogant poor, as Abu Hurairah narrated in Sahih Muslim. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It warns us against reminding the poor of favors, falsely swearing, and trailing clothes. They all will get a severe punishment, (2) It proves Allah's attributes of speech and sight in the manner befitting Him, without any similarity to human attributes. If He neither spoke nor looked at the three mentioned types, whom he would speak and look at.."}, {"number": 35, "hadith": "Abu Huraira narrated, \"The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, 'There are three (types) with whom Allah will neither speak on the Day of Resurrection nor purify them - Other narration added, '... nor look at them...' - and they will have a painful torment: Aged adulterer, lying king, and arrogant destitute one.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet \ufdfa used to warn his companions against inferior qualities and unacceptable deeds. He was very keen to guide them to all that making them closer to Paradise. In this hadith, he told us about three types of people to whom Allah would not pleasingly speak on the Day of Resurrection to belittle and punish them. He also would neither mercifully look at them nor purify them from their sins and vileness. Above all, they would get a severe punishment. They are as follows: (1) An old man who has committed adultery even though his maturity, reason, lack of lust, and absence of justification, the issues which prevent him from doing so, unlike the young man of strong lust and relative control of himself. The same applies to an old woman if she commits adultery. Generally, adultery is a great sin but it becomes greater if committed by the old ones, (2) A king who used to deceive and lie to his people for his personal benefits. This applies to everyone who is in charge of Muslim affairs. In the narration of An-Nasa'i, the Prophet \ufdfa said, \"And the unjust leader.\", Lying is one of the hypocrites' attributes and generally forbidden for all people but it becomes greater if committed by a king because his word is supreme among people so he does not need to lie to them. He has to be frank and truthful when promising them, (3) A person who is used to be arrogant in spite of his poverty and disability to provide for his sons. He is supposed to be modest with Allah and people and avoid arrogance, for there is no reason making him behave like that. The hadith may refer to a poor who is unable to provide for his sons but he refuses to work or take charity out of arrogance. Thus, he is sinful for preventing food or clothes from reaching his sons. Generally, arrogance is a great sin but it becomes greater if committed by a poor one. This is why you find people surprised when seeing a rich modest person, for lots of rich people are arrogant. These three types of people are addressed by this punishment because of their weak reasons for committing the mentioned sins. They committed them out of arrogance more than needing them. The Prophet\u2019s mentioning these three types does not mean exclusiveness, for he mentioned some other types that will get that punishment such as the one who used to lengthen and trail his clothes, the one who used to swear to promote his goods, and the one who used to remind the poor of his gifts, as narrated by Abu Dharr in Sahih Muslim. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It proves Allah's attributes of speech and sight in the manner befitting Him, without any similarity to human attributes. If He neither spoke nor looked at the three mentioned types, whom he would speak and look at and, (2) It warns us against adultery, lying, and arrogance.."}, {"number": 36, "hadith": "Thabet ibn Ad-Dahhak narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \u201cA person is not obliged to fulfil a vow about something he does not possess. Cursing a believer is like murdering him. Whoever kills himself with something in this world will be punished with it on the day of resurrection. Whoever makes a false claim to gain much thereby Allah will give him less instead of more. Whoever falsely swears an oath which he is asked to take.\u201d.", "commentary": "Allah granted his Prophet \ufdfa the most comprehensive words so he used to preach and teach people with the fewest words that carried many meanings to hearts. In this hadith, he clarifies that a person is not obliged to fulfill a vow about something he does not possess such as his saying, \u201cIf Allah cured my son, I would slaughter my neighbor\u2019s cow.\u201d A vow is to commit oneself to carry out a mandatory matter. The Prophet \ufdfa adds, \u201cCursing a believer is like murdering him.\u201d Cursing is to ask Allah to expel someone from His mercy while murdering him is to expel him from life. This is one of the greatest Prophetic warnings against cursing Muslims. The Prophet \ufdfa adds that whoever kills himself by using something sharp, drinking something poisonous, or falling from a mountain, Allah will punish him in the same way he kills himself in the hereafter. Thus, the punishment will be of the same type as the crime. The Prophet \ufdfa adds that if a person makes a false claim, regarding linage or rights, to obtain money or benefits, Allah will give him less instead of more. As a result, if he falsely claims to obtain lots of money, Allah will contrarily decrease his money. Instead of gaining more benefits, he will gain less bliss. The last sin the Prophet \ufdfa adds is to falsely swear an oath before a judge or ruler to falsely take others\u2019 rights or benefits. He mentions the punishment in another hadith narrated by Ibn Masoud in the Two Sahihs that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \u201cIf anyone falsely swears an oath which he is asked to take (by a judge or so) to usurp a Muslim\u2019s property, he will meet Allah Who will be angry with him.\u201d Allah confirms this meaning in his saying, \u201cVerily, those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah\u2019s Covenant and their oaths, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter (Paradise). Neither will Allah speak to them, nor look at them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful torment.\u201d (Aal Imran: 77) They replace Allah\u2019s covenant and sacred oaths with their temporary worldly whims of money, benefits, etc. Allah describes the price as low out of demeaning it, for they betray Allah\u2019s covenant and dare to falsely swear by his name. Their gain is little whatever its amounts in comparison to Allah\u2019s pleasing and fulfilling His covenants. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It is forbidden to take vows except for what one owns, and (2) It is forbidden to falsely swear by Allah.."}, {"number": 37, "hadith": "Omar ibn Al-Khattab reported, \u201cOn the day (of the battle) of Khaibar, some Companions of the Prophet \ufdfa came and said, \u2018So-and-so is a martyr and so-and-so is a martyr.\u2019 Until they came to a man and said, \u2018So-and-so is a martyr.\u2019 The Prophet \ufdfa said, \u2018No. I have seen him in Hell for a mantle - or cloak - which he has stolen.\u2019 Then he said, \u2018O Ibn Al-Khattab, go and announce among people that none will enter Paradise but believers.\u2019 I went out and announced that none will enter Paradise but believers.\u201d.", "commentary": "The true belief in Allah and what it requires is a reason for entering Paradise. A heart\u2019s belief is followed by a clear obedience in one's behavior and acts. In this hadith, Omar ibn Al-Khattab narrated a situation after Khaybar battle that occurred between Muslims and Jews in the 7th year AH. It was a village inhabited by Jews about 153 Km north of Medina. After the battle, some of the Prophet's Companions were counting this battle's martyrs until they mentioned a man and said, \"So-and-so is a martyr.\" The Prophet \ufdfa commented, \"No. I have seen him in Hell for a mantle - or cloak - which he has stolen.\" A cloak is a black square garment. He took it from the spoils without the Prophet's knowledge and consent. He did not give it to the Prophet within the spoils to be divided later. The Prophet \ufdfa commanded Omar to go and announce among people that none will enter Paradise but believers. None will initially enter it except those believing in Allah outwardly and inwardly. It was a stern warning to those violating Allah's and the Prophet's commands, for a believer may be punished in Hell for his sins. Afterward, Allah may save him if he wills. In Sahih Muslim, Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \"He is not a believer who defrauds and steals (from the spoils).\" Both the Quran and Sunnah clearly mentioned that it is the one who steals war spoils before they are divided. He will come on the Day of Resurrection with the thing he gained. Allah said, \"And whoever betrays, [taking unlawfully], will come with what he took on the Day of Resurrection.\" (Aal-Imran: 161) This hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It is permissible to praise the dead and mention their virtues, (2) It warns against stealing spoils or public funds, (3) It confirms that stealing spoils contradicts faith, for this person commits a hidden sin while openly betraying Allah only. If he had been a true believer, he would not have hidden from people while openly committing it before Allah, and (4) The quality of faith may be removed due to evil acts.."}, {"number": 38, "hadith": "Jaber ibn Abdullah narrated that At-Tufail ibn Amr Ad-Dousy came to the Prophet \ufdfa and said, \u201cO Messenger of Allah \ufdfa, do you need a strong fort and protection?\u201d There was a fort that belonged to the tribe of Daos during the pre-Islamic period. The Prophet \ufdfa declined that, for it was the role that Allah reserved for the Ansar. When the Prophet \ufdfa immigrated to Medina, At-Tufail immigrated along with a man from his tribe. Medina\u2019s climate did not suit them so his friend fell sick. He could not be patient so he took his arrowheads and cut his knuckles. His hands were bleeding till he died. At-Tufail saw him in a dream in a good state while wrapping his hands. He asked him, \u201cWhat did your God do with you?\u201d He replied, \u201cHe forgave me owing to my immigration to His Prophet \ufdfa.\u201d He asked, \u201cWhat do I see you wrapping your hands?\u201d He replied, \u201cI was told, \u2018We would not fix anything of yours which you damaged.\u2019\u201d At-Tufail related that to Allah\u2019s Messenger \ufdfa who said, \u201cO Allah, for his hands grant forgiveness.\u201d.", "commentary": "The Prophet \ufdfa called people for Islam amid an environment full of disbelief and polytheism, which made embracing Islam and immigration to Medina difficult decisions. Immigration to Medina meant leaving one\u2019s homeland, property, and family, a decision that led to a great reward. This hadith relates some aspects of At-Tufail ibn Amr Ad-Dousy\u2019s life, one of the Prophet\u2019s companions. He was one of his people\u2019s notables. Upon embracing Islam, he traveled from Yemen, his homeland, to Mecca to offer to the Prophet \ufdfa, before the Prophet's immigration to Medina, to immigrate to Dous tribe in Yemen to live in its strong fort which belonged to them in the pre-Islamic period. The Prophet \ufdfa declined, for it was the role that Allah reserved for the Ansar to honor them with the Prophet\u2019s immigration to them. Allah did not open the Prophet\u2019s heart to immigrate to a place other than Medina or allow him to do so. Years later, At-Tufail immigrated in the seventh year with Abu Hurairah or in the eighth year with a man from his tribe to Medina and settled in it. They hated Medina\u2019s climate which did not suit their bodies. As a result, At-Tufail\u2019s friend fell sick and was so disturbed and impatient that he took his arrowheads and cut his knuckles. His hands were bleeding till he died. At-Tufail saw him in a dream in a good state while wrapping his hands. He asked him about Allah\u2019s act with him. He confirmed that Allah had honored and forgiven him due to his immigration to the Prophet \ufdfa, which refers to Allah\u2019s great reward for immigration to the Prophet \ufdfa. To answer At-Tufail\u2019s question about the reason for covering his hands, the man replied that he was told that Allah would not fix his hands that he cut out of impatience. When At-Tufail related that to the Prophet \ufdfa, the Prophet \ufdfa asked Allah to also include his hands within His forgiveness and mercy. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It shows Allah\u2019s great reward for immigration to His Prophet \ufdfa, (2) It clarifies that Allah forgives whomever He wills among the believers, (3) It indicates the Prophet\u2019s perfect compassion towards the believers, for he asked Allah to forgive the man\u2019s sin he committed by his hands, (4) It confirms At-Tufail\u2019s great virtue of his concern for the Prophet\u2019s safety and his desire to be honored with protecting him in his homeland, (5) It confirms Ansar\u2019s merit and prestige, (6) Muslims cannot consider the one who kills himself a disbeliever unless he believes that this act is permissible, and (7) It proves the punishment of some sinners.."}, {"number": 39, "hadith": "Abu Huraira narrated, \"The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, 'Verily, Allah will make wind more delicate than silk blowing from Yemen.

For example, He will take believers' souls near before the coming of the Last Day when disbelief increases. In this hadith, the Prophet \ufdfa confirmed that Allah, near the Last Day, would blow a wind from Yemen which would be more delicate than silk out of kindness and honor for the believers. It would spare none who has faith equal to the weight of grain (in another narration \"a dust particle\") but causes him to die. Their souls would easily come out with their gentle breeze. They would be saved from this life of distress and mixing evil people to satisfyingly live in Paradise under Allah's pleasure away from those evil ones. At that time, the Last Day would begin. In another hadith in Sahih Muslim, Anas ibn Malek narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \"The Hour (Resurrection) will not occur until 'Allah, Allah' is not said on earth.\" It is a metaphor for the fact that it will come upon people who neither worship, supplicate, nor even mention Allah's name. This hadith does not contradict the hadith in the two Sahihs in which the Prophet said, \"\u2018A section of my nation will not cease fighting for the truth and will prevail till the Day of Resurrection,\" for the former hadith means that they will continue to adhere to the truth until this delicate wind causes them to die near the Day of Resurrection. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It proves the Prophet's prophethood, (2) It clarifies that dying the righteous ones is one of the signs of the Hour, (3) It confirms that the Hour will only come upon the worst people, and (4) It explains that faith increases and decreases.."}, {"number": 40, "hadith": "Abu Huraira narrated, \u201cThe Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u2018Be prompt in doing righteous deeds before (you are overtaken by) turbulence which would be like a portion of the dark night.

He also used to warn it against negligence and delaying today\u2019s obedience till tomorrow, for one does not know what tomorrow will bring. In this hadith, he commanded his followers to hasten to do good deeds before the escalated trials of the last worldly life, which may make them busy with them or distract them from the virtuous deeds. The trials he talked about are those mixing truthfulness with falsehood so one cannot distinguish between them. These trials will be like undistinguished portions of the dark night. This is a metaphor for its severity, harm, and comprehensiveness of all those witnessing them. As a result, a man would be a believer in the morning then turn to be a disbeliever in the evening or a believer in the evening then a disbeliever in the morning. These trials may deprive him of the attribute of faith to the extent that he may turn and change his belief in the same day for pleasures with poor price. These worldly enjoyments will disappear one day whether we leave them or they leave us. Undoubtedly, promptness in doing righteous deeds protects from trials. As a result, the believers should beware and be prompt to do them before it is too late. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It is a sign of the Prophet's prophethood, (2) It encourages us to hasten to the virtuous deeds before we are diverted by trials, (3) It warns against trials and temptations, (4) It urges us to not be deceived by our righteous deeds and instead keep fearing Allah, for the rewards of deeds are decided by their ending, and (5) It confirms the importance of sticking to the religion and being cautious when enjoying the worldly pleasures.."}, {"number": 41, "hadith": "Ibn Shemasa Al-Mary narrated, \u201cWe visited Amr ibn Al-'As when he was on his deathbed. He turned his face towards the wall while weeping for a long time. His son said to him twice, \u2018O father, did not the Prophet \ufdfa give you glad tidings of such and such?\u2019 Amr turned his face to him and said, \u2018The best thing we have (for hereafter) is the testimony of \u2018There is no true god but Allah and that Muhammad \ufdfa is the Messenger of Allah.\u2019 I have passed through three phases (during my life). I remember that I hated none more than the Prophet \ufdfa and I did not have any other desire stronger than that of killing him. Had I died in that state, I would have definitely been one of Hell\u2019s dwellers. When Allah instilled loving for Islam in my heart, I went to the Prophet \ufdfa and said, \u2018Extend your right hand, so that I pledge allegiance to you.\u2019 He \ufdfa stretched out his right hand, but I withdrew mine. He \ufdfa said, \u2018What is the matter, Amr?\u2019 I said, \u2018I wanted to lay down some conditions.\u2019 He \ufdfa asked, \u2018What conditions do you want to set out?\u2019 I replied, \u2018To be granted forgiveness.\u2019 He \ufdfa said, \u2018Did you not know that (embracing) Islam wipe out what (misdeeds) was before it, emigration wipe out what (misdeeds) was before it, and pilgrimage wipe out what (misdeeds) was before it?\u2019 None was dearer to me than the Prophet \ufdfa and none was more respectable than him in my eyes. I could not catch a full glimpse at his face due to my utmost respect. If I was asked to describe him, I would not be able to do so, for I could not catch a full glimpse at his face. Had I died in that state, I would have hoped to be one of Paradise\u2019s dwellers. Thereafter, I was made responsible for many things which I did not know what it held in store for me. When I die, do not let a mourner or a fire accompany my bier. When you bury me, throw the earth gently over me and stand over my grave for the space of slaughtering and distributing a camel\u2019s meat so that I enjoy your intimacy while answering my God\u2019s Messengers.\u2019\u201d.", "commentary": "The true believer combines fearing Allah\u2019s punishment by avoiding prohibitions with hoping for His mercy by performing righteous acts. The Prophet\u2019s Companions showed the best examples of this behavior. In this hadith, Abderrahman ibn Shemasa Al-Mahry narrated that they visited Amr ibn Al-\u2018As when he was on his deathbed. He was weeping for a long time out of fearing Allah and remembering the Day of Resurrection despite his honor of companying the Prophet \ufdfa and outstanding courage in defending Islam. It was the ongoing state of the righteous people that they used to fear Allah and weep due to their \u2018dereliction,\u2019 no matter how great their obedience was. Amr turned his face to the wall lest the attendants may have distanced himself from communing with Allah and contemplating the Hereafter\u2019s expected events. He also wanted to conceal his grief, sorrow, and tears. To relieve his sadness and calm him down, his son Abdullah repeatedly reminded him of the Prophet\u2019s glad tidings to him. In the narration of Ahmad, \u201cHe was reminding him of his companionship of the Prophet \ufdfa and conquering the Levant.\u201d Then Amr turned his face and said to them that the best thing he had for the hereafter was the belief in Allah and His Messenger \ufdfa. Afterward, he divided his lifetime into three phases: (1) It was the period of his disbelief. He deeply hated the Prophet \ufdfa and his highest desire was to have a chance to kill him. He confirmed that if he had died in that state, he would have entered Hell forever, (2) It was his period of embracing Islam, accompanying the Prophet \ufdfa, and doing righteous deeds. On that day, Allah instilled faith in his heart, he went to the Prophet \ufdfa after Al-Hudaybeya Treaty to pledge allegiance to him and promise to follow him and support Islam. He extended his hand then withdrew it. When the Prophet \ufdfa asked him about the reason, he confirmed that he had a condition before taking that important step. He wanted his misdeeds to be forgiven. To answer hi, the Prophet \ufdfa mentioned three matters that erase one\u2019s previous misdeeds and his disbelief, the most severe sin: (1) Islam, (2) Emigration: It was obligatory to preserve one\u2019s religion by migrating from Mecca to Medina during the Prophet\u2019s lifetime, and (3) The accepted pilgrimage. In the two Sahihs, the Prophet \ufdfa said, \u201cWhoever performs pilgrimage for Allah's sake and neither has sexual relations (with his wife) nor does evil, he will return as if he were a newborn (free from all sins).\u201d At this stage, the Prophet \ufdfa was his most beloved and respectable one to the extent that he was not able to catch a full glimpse at the Prophet\u2019s face due to utmost respect. Additionally, he could not describe him for the same reason. He confirmed that if he had died in that great state, he would have hoped to be among the people of Paradise, (3) It was the stage of having political responsibilities after the Prophet \ufdfa died. He described those events of that period that he did not know what they held in store for him. He did not know whether he would be rewarded or punished for that period. He conquered and then was appointed as a ruler of Egypt for ten years and three months throughout Omar\u2019s, Othman\u2019s, and Mu\u2019aweya\u2019s caliphates. He participated in Mu\u2019aweya\u2019s war against Ali ibn Abi Taleb. Finally, he advised the attendants and his family to neither let any female mourner nor fire accompany his funeral. A female mourner is a woman used to raise her voice and cry while counting the deceased\u2019s virtues. As for accompanying the deceased with fire, it may mean one of the following possibilities: (1) It was a habit that some followed as an optimism that the deceased would be saved from Hell, (2) It was an act of the pre-Islamic times, or (3) It was a habit of reprehensible proudness. Afterward, he advised them to throw the earth gently over his grave and stand around it for the space of slaughtering and distributing a camel\u2019s meat so that he enjoyed their intimacy while he was answering the grave\u2019s angels. This hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It shows the high prestige of Islam, migration, and pilgrimage, for each can remove one\u2019s previous misdeeds, (2) It is forbidden that a deceased is followed by a mourner or a fire, (3) It clarifies how deeply the companions respect and revere the Prophet, (4) To die having good thought of Allah, a dying person has to be reminded for his righteous deeds and Quranic verses and Prophetic hadith talking about virtues of hope and forgiveness. We have to give him glad tidings of what Allah has prepared for Muslims, (5) A true believer always fears Allah, regardless of his abundant righteous deeds, (6) It proves that there will be two angels in the grave to ask everyone certain questions about Islam, (7) It urges us to stay around the grave a little after burial to comfort the deceased and supplicate Allah for his steadfastness, and (8) It shows that we should throw the earth gently over the grave and avoid sitting on it.."}, {"number": 42, "hadith": "Abu Hurairah said, \"When this verse was revealed to the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) \u2018To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and whether you disclose what is in your ownselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. Then He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And Allah is Able to do all things.\u2019 (Al-Baqarah: 284), the Messenger's Companions felt it hard, came to the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa), sat down on their knees, and said, 'O Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa), we were assigned to do some duties which were within our power such as prayer, fasting, jihad, and charity. There was a verse revealed to you that was beyond our power.' The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said, 'Do you want to say what the people of two Books (Jews and Christians) said before you, 'We hear and disobey?' You should rather say, 'We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your Forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).' Thereupon, they said, 'We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your Forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).' When the people recited it and it smoothly flowed on their tongues, then Allah revealed immediately afterward, 'The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say), 'We make no distinction between any of His Messengers' \u2014 and they say, 'We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your Forgive ness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).' When they did that, Allah abrogated it and revealed, 'Allah burdens not a\u2009person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has incurred. 'Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error,' The Prophet (\ufdfa) said, 'Yes.' 'Our Lord! Lay not on us a\u2009burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians).' The Prophet (\ufdfa) said, 'Yes.' 'Our Lord! Put not on us a\u2009burden greater than we have strength to bear.' The Prophet (\ufdfa) said, 'Yes.' 'Pardon us and grant us Forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Supporter and give us victory over the disbelieving people.' The Prophet (\ufdfa) said, 'Yes.'\".", "commentary": "The Prophet\u2019s Companions were quick at responding to Allah\u2019s and His Prophet\u2019s orders. In this hadith, Abu Hurairah narrated a story about the following Quranic verse, \u201cTo Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and whether you disclose what is in your ownselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. Then He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And Allah is Able to do all things.\u201d (Al-Baqarah: 284) It means that all creation in this universe belongs to Allah only. He is the true Creator, Manager, and Owner unlike what people own in this life as temporary property. He is All-Knower to the extent that he knows whether people reveal or conceal. All people will be held accountable on the Day of Resurrection to be rewarded out of his mercy, or punished out of his justice, for He has the real power over all things. Once revealed, it was difficult for the Prophet\u2019s Companions to be held accountable for their thoughts and feelings. Some went to the Prophet (\ufdfa), sat down on their knees out of fear, and confirmed that all obligatory Islamic acts were bearable but that verse was deeply unbearable. They were afraid of being held accountable for thoughts and feelings that none could control. The Prophet (\ufdfa) was not satisfied with their way and was afraid that they were affected by the way of satisfying with some rules and dissatisfying with others. He confirmed to them that it was the way of the people of the Book to say, \u201cWe hear and we disobey.\u201d (Al-Baqarah: 93 & Aal-Imran: 46) Instead, he commanded them to say, \u201cWe hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your Forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).\u201d (Al-Baqarah: 285) When they said that out of submission and humbleness to Allah, He abrogated it with the following verse, \u201cThe Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say), 'We make no distinction between any of His Messengers' \u2014 and they say, 'We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your Forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all). Allah burdens not a\u2009person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has incurred. 'Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error, Our Lord! Lay not on us a\u2009burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians). Our Lord! Put not on us a\u2009burden greater than we have strength to bear. Pardon us and grant us Forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Supporter and give us victory over the disbelieving people.\u201d (Al-Baqarah: 285, 286) It means that both the Prophet (\ufdfa) and the faithful believe in the Quran then confirms that all believe in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. The faithful believe that Allah is the One and Self Sufficient, without any partner. They believe in all the angels, prophets, and books revealed to his messengers. They do not differentiate between any of them. They do not believe in others while disbelieving in others. Rather, they believe that they are all truthful, righteous, guided, and guiding people to the path of goodness even if some may abrogate the laws of others based on Allah\u2019s will until all laws are abrogated by the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s law, the Seal of all Prophets, on whose law the Hour will be established. On the other hand, when the believers hear Allah\u2019s commands, they obey and act upon them. They always ask Allah\u2019s forgiveness, for they deeply know that to Him is the return on the Day of reckoning. Moreover, Allah does not burden any\u2009person beyond his scope. He is rewarded for his righteous deeds and punished for his evil deeds. Allah does not punish his servants for their thoughts, feelings, or whispers. Then, Allah mentions some believers\u2019 supplications with his answers. They ask Allah not to punish them if they forget or unintentionally make mistakes. They ask Allah not to burden them with unbearable matters as he did with those before them as the Children of Israel and others. They ask Allah not to put on them greater responsibilities that are beyond their strength. Then, they ask Him to forgive their sins and have mercy on them, for He is their Master. Finally, they ask Him to help them against the disbelieving people. The Prophet (\ufdfa) confirmed that Allah said, \u201cYes\u201d as a response to each supplication, out of His great favors upon those submitting to His command. As for those saying, \u201cWe hear and we disobey,\u201d He burdened them with sin and guilt and then punished them for that in this world. On the contrary, Allah honored this nation, unlike any previous ones, provided the Prophet\u2019s Companions with firm faith and blessings, and praised them by saying, \u201cThe Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say), 'We make no distinction between any of His Messengers' \u2014 and they say, 'We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your Forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).\u201d (Al-Baqarah: 28) Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It clarifies the Companions\u2019 deep respect for Allah\u2019s and His Prophet\u2019s command, (2) It confirms that Allah does not burden us with any unbearable matters such as whisperings or thoughts, as long as we do not act upon them, and (3) It proves the abrogation of some rules related to some Quranic verses although they are still recited in the Noble Quran.."}, {"number": 43, "hadith": "Ibn Abbas narrated, \u201cWhen this verse was revealed, \u2018Whether you show what is within yourselves or conceal it, Allah will ring you to account for it.\u2019 (Al-Baqarah: 284), it made the Prophet\u2019s companions more afraid than before of any other verse. The Prophet \ufdfa said, \u2018Say, \u2018We have heard, obeyed, and submitted ourselves.\u2019 Allah instilled faith in their hearts and revealed this Quranic verse, \u2018Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity. It will have [the consequence of] what [good] it has gained, and it will bear [the consequence of] what [evil] it has earned. \u2018Our Lord, do not impose blame upon us if we have forgotten or erred.\u2019 (Al-Baqarah: 286) Allah said, \u2018I indeed did it.\u2019 He also revealed this Quranic verse, \u2018Our Lord, and lay not upon us a burden like that which You laid upon those before us.\u2019 Allah said, \u2018I indeed did it.\u2019 He also revealed, \u2018\u2026 and forgive us and have mercy upon us. You are our protector.\u2019 Allah said, \u2018I indeed did it.\u2019\u201d.", "commentary": "The Prophet's companions used to quickly respond to Allah's and His Prophet's commands. In this hadith, Abdullah ibn Abbas narrated a hadith about the following verse, \u2018Whether you show what is within yourselves or conceal it, Allah will ring you to account for it.\u2019 (Al-Baqarah: 284) It means whatever you commit or INTEND to do evil deeds, Allah will ring you to account for it. He confirmed that the Prophet's companions were deeply afraid when this verse was revealed. They were wondering about how they would be punished for something they did not say or do. Anyway, the Prophet guided them to listen and obey Allah's command. As a result, Allah helped and provided them with complete faith, goodness, and deep submission. Accordingly, Allah abrogated the meaning of the verse, \"or conceal it.\" and revealed, \"Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity.\" (Al-Baqarah: 286) The Prophet said in the two Sahihs, \"Allah forgives my nation the evil promptings which arise within them as long as they do not act upon them or speak about them.\u201d Allah clarified in this verse that all people would be rewarded for the righteous deeds they did and punished for the evil deeds they committed. Then He inspired us to supplicate, repent, and turn to Him as in his saying, \"Our Lord, do not impose blame upon us if we have forgotten or erred.\" (Al-Baqarah: 286) It meant: O God, do not punish us for what we unwillingly forget or neglect. So Allah said, \u201cI indeed did it.\u201d They added, \"Our Lord, and lay not upon us a burden like that which You laid upon those before us.\" (Al-Baqarah: 286) A burden is a sin. So Allah said, \u201cI indeed did it.\u201d They added, \"And pardon us; and forgive us; and have mercy upon us.\" (Al-Baqarah: 286) So Allah said, \u201cI indeed did it.\u201d This refers to His great bounty upon His submissive believers to His command. As for those saying, \"We listened and disobeyed,\" God would burden them with sin and punish them with it in this life before the Hereafter. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) The Companions\u2019 intense veneration for Allah's and His Prophet's commands, (2) Allah only commands us to do what we can bear, (3) The devilish whisperings to our hearts will not harm us as long as we neglect and stop thinking about them, (4) Allah forgave Muslims for what they spoke to their own selves as long as they do not speak or act upon, and (5) Allah abrogated some Quranic verses' meanings although they are still recited.."}, {"number": 44, "hadith": "Abu Hurairah narrated, \"The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, 'Allah said, 'If my servant speaks about doing a good deed, I will record it as one good deed to him although he did not do it. If he did it, I would record it ten good deeds. If he speaks about committing a bad deed, I will forgive him as long as he did not commit it. If he committed it, I would record it as one evil deed.' The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, 'The angels said, 'O God, Your servant wants to commit an evil act.' Allah, the best watcher, replied, 'Watch him, if he commits it, record it as one evil act. If he refrains from doing it, record it as one good deed, for he refrains from it for me.' The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, 'Whoever among you has a good faith, all righteous acts he does are multiplied from ten to seven hundred times. All evil acts he commits are recorded as they are till he meets Allah.'\".", "commentary": "Allah, the Almighty, is full of mercy and generous in reward. He treats His servants with justice and grace. The following narrations confirm His great generosity in writing down people's righteous and evil acts. The Prophet (\ufdfa) narrated that Allah confirmed in the Sacred Hadith that if a person intended to do a righteous act, but did not do it, Allah would record it as a complete righteous act. If he did it, Allah would multiply it tenfold. In the Two Sahihs, Ibn Abbas narrated that the Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \"Allah will multiply it tenfold up to seven hundred times up to many multiples.\" Allah said, \"The likeness of those who spend their wealth in the Way of Allah, is as the likeness of a\u2009grain (of corn); it grows seven ears, and each ear has a\u2009hundred grains. Allah gives manifold increase to whom He wills. And Allah is All\u2011Sufficient for His creatures\u2019 needs, All\u2011Knower.\" (Al-Baqarah: 261) This relative reward is based on one's sincerity, truthfulness, and reaching righteous acts to others. On the other hand, Allah confirmed that if a person intended to commit an evil act but did not commit it due to his shyness and fear of Allah, Allah would forgive him. In the Two Sahihs, Ibn Abbas narrated that the Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \u201cAllah will record it for him as a complete good deed.\u201d If he committed it, Allah would record it as one evil act out of his mercy without increasing or doubling it as in recording the righteous acts. As for the angels' saying, \"O God, Your servant wants to commit an evil act,\" He is Allah who informs his angels about his servant's intention. As for his saying, \"... for he refrains from it for me,\" He means that the servant does not commit the evil act only because of his fear of Allah, struggling against his self that tends to commit evil acts, and disobeying his prohibited whims. As for the Prophet's saying, \"Whoever among you has good faith,\" he means one's inward and outward sincerity and belief. Finally, this hadith shows Allah's great mercy and grace upon His servants, and (2) It confirms the angels' observation of human acts.."}, {"number": 45, "hadith": "Abu Huraira narrated, \u201cSome of the Prophet\u2019s companions \ufdfa came and asked him, \u2018We have thoughts which none of us dare to talk about.\u2019 He asked, \u2018Have you experienced that?\u2019 They answered, \u2018Yes.\u2019 He said, \u2018That is the clear faith.\u2019\u201d.", "commentary": "Having a false thought is one of the matters that may corrupt our hearts. It leads us to think about Allah's self, not his blessings. Regular sticking to this type of idea may lead to disbelief.

In this hadith, Abu Hurairah narrated that some Prophet's companions came and asked him, \"We have thoughts which none of us dare to talk about.\" They were actually trying to stop and deny these ugly insinuations such as, \"Who created Allah? How is He? What is he made of?\" Because they believed that it was not appropriate for them to think in this manner about Allah. They were afraid that such insinuations would be considered sins. Then the Prophet (\ufdfa) asked them, \u201cHave you experienced it?\u201d He confirmed that these thoughts may have come to a believer's head but his faith in Allah drove him to ask about a solution. Moreover, he confirmed the deep faith of his companions by three proofs: (1) Their denial of those terrible thoughts raised by Satan, (2) Their knowledge that they are corrupting insinuations, and (3) Their stopping from expressing them. On the other hand, the disbeliever insists on what is in his heart of likening Allah to His creatures, unlike the true believers who deny such insinuations and stop attributing these descriptions to Allah. As a result, he expels these doubts and seeks refuge in Allah from Satan. This hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It confirms that Satan used to whisper to humans until he takes them out of faith, so the believer has to be cautious, (2) When such devilish insinuations come to a believer's mind, he has to remain silent and stop speaking about it. Instead, he has to seek refuge in Allah from Satan, (3) It explains how the Prophet's companions took much care of their hearts and were cautious of what may invalidate their faith, and (4) A Muslim is allowed to ask a scholar about any issues or questions he has. He is not allowed to keep silent out of shame, for a Muslim should not be ashamed of asking about the truth.."}, {"number": 46, "hadith": "Abu Huraira narrated, \u201cThe Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, 'People will keep wondering till it will be said, \u2018Allah created all things but who created Allah?\u2019 Whoever finds something like that should say, \u2018I believe in Allah.\u2019\u201d In another narration, \u201cThe devil comes to one of you and says, \u2018Who created the sky?

This will be his punishment on condition that he thinks this act is permissible and does not return the property to its owner. Islam considers it a grave sin, for the false oath is one of the major sins, and the Islamic rulings are based on apparent proofs and oaths, even if the person to whom the ruling was made was a liar.

If you are killed, you will be in Paradise, and if you kill him, he will be in Hell.'\" The Prophet confirmed that he would get the status of a martyr in Hereafter, for he was unjustly killed while defending his property. As for his case in this worldly life, he is washed and prayed over. This does not require that he would get the reward of a war martyr. On the other hand, the other man deserves to enter Hell for his oppression. It is Allah's decision to punish or forgive him. He would definitely enter Hell if he intentionally thought that his forbidden act by Islam was allowable. Hence, he becomes a disbeliever and will not be forgiven, out of warning against attacking people\u2019s property. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It prohibits taking a Muslim\u2019s wealth without his consent, and (2) It confirms that there is no retribution or blood money for killing those fighting Muslims.."}, {"number": 50, "hadith": "Ibn Omar narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \u201cVerily, Islam began as something strange and will be strange as it began so glad tidings to the strangers. It recedes between the two mosques just as the serpent crawls back into its hole.\u201d.", "commentary": "Islam appeared in a world filled with injustice, polytheism, and ignorance. Its luminous teachings were strange among people living in complete darkness while its first followers were suffering from several trials until it prevailed among people. In this hadith, the Prophet (\ufdfa) showed that Islam began as something strange due to its few followers and their suffering. The Meccans wondered about Islam, for it refused the ignorant traditions of the environment from which it emerged. Afterward, the Prophet and his companions immigrated to Medina, which was an additional image of strangeness and suffering. He began to spread Islam and the people began to enter into it in multitude. Later, he confirmed that Islam would return to be strange as it began. It would become strange in its followers' hearts, even if they are large in number. Its followers would adhere to the customs of pre-Islamic times. This way of deficiency and disruption would prevail to the extent that Islam would be stuck by a few Muslims as it began. Then, the Prophet informed that Islam would return and join between the Sacred Mosque in Mecca and the Prophetic Mosque in Medina, which were the cradle of Islam, just like the serpent that crawls back into its hole when it feels afraid. Likewise, Islam will return to Mecca and Medina as it began. Because of this severity, the Prophet said in another narration in Muslim, \"So Toba to the strangers.\" The word \"Toba\" may either mean: (1) That Paradise will be for those few Muslims at the beginning and end of Islam, or (2) That joy and comfort will be for those few Muslims. The Prophet specifically mentioned those Muslims, for their patience in the face of harm from infidels and heretics. They have been sticking to the true religion and authentic Sunnah even after the people have corrupted and changed the clear message of Islam. Finally, this hadith presented the following benefits: (1) It refers to the virtues of the Sacred and Prophetic Mosques to which Islam returns and joins, which is an indication that the believers always flee to them to protect themselves against temptations, and (2) It is a sign of the Prophet's prophethood.."}, {"number": 51, "hadith": "Anas narrated, \u201cThe Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u2018The hour (of resurrection) will not occur as long as anyone says, \u2018Allah, Allah.\u2019\u201d.", "commentary": "At the end of this worldly life, lots of issues will change while immorality and disobedience will spread. At that time, Allah will allow the beginning of Resurrection's Day. In this hadith, the Prophet (\ufdfa) confirmed that this day will not come as long as anyone says, \"Allah, Allah.\" It means that there will not be anyone who remembers the name of Allah or worship him. There will be just the evilest people, for Allah has taken the believers' souls, as in Sahih Muslim that Amr ibn Al-Aas narrated that the Prophet said, \u201cThen Allah will raise a wind whose smell is similar to musk and whose touch is similar to silk. It will cause any person who has the weight of a seed of faith in his heart to die. Then only the evilest people will remain to witness the beginning of the Resurrection Day.\" This does not contradict what was authentically proven in Sahih Muslim that Jaber ibn Abdullah narrated that the Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \u201cA group of my nation will always fight for the sake of rightness and overcome (their enemies) till the day of resurrection,\" for it means they would be like that till that light wind causes them to die before the Day of Resurrection when its signs begins to appear. Finally, this hadith contains the following lessons: (1) It shows a sign of the Prophet's prophethood, (2) It clarifies the virtue of the believers, for Allah will honor them by causing them to die before the hereafter, and (3) It confirms the virtue of remembering Allah, for those remembering him will not witness the beginning of the Day of Resurrection.."}, {"number": 52, "hadith": "Abu Huraira narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u201cBy Him in Whose hand is the life of Muhammad, he who among this community, Jewish or Christian, hears about me and dies without believing in what was revealed to me, he will be one of the people of Hell.\u201d.", "commentary": "The Prophet (\ufdfa) was sent to all people, including Jews and Christians. All have to believe and follow his guidance. In this hadith, he swore by Allah in Whose hand is the Prophet's life and all creatures' lives. The Prophet often swears in this way. He swore that if anyone from Jinns or mankind heard, during or after the Prophet's life till the day of resurrection, about his message, he would have to believe in him. If anyone dies without believing in him, he is a disbeliever and will be punished with Hell. The Prophet (\ufdfa) mentioned the Jews and Christians as an example. It is just like he mentions a specific matter after a general rule. This is the case for the People who have a divine book. How should the case be for those who have none?! Allah said, \"Say, [O Muhammad], 'O mankind, indeed I am the Messenger of Allah to you all.'\" (Al-A'raf: 158) Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It indicates that all people have to believe in the Prophet's message that abrogated all previous messages and (2) Whoever does not believe in the Prophet's message is not a believer but he will be punished with Hell, even if he claims he believes in Allah and some of his messengers such as Moses and Jesus (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them all).."}, {"number": 53, "hadith": "Jaber ibn Abdullah narrated, \u201cI heard the Prophet \ufdfa said, \u2018A section of my nation will not cease fighting for the truth and will prevail till the Day of Resurrection.

This nation will remain the last caller to Allah and adhere to the clear truth. All other nations unify against it due to this right. In this hadith, the Prophet (\ufdfa) confirmed that a group of this nation would keep fighting Islam's enemies for supporting truth and religion. They would keep raising Islam's banner above other ones and overcoming all enemies near the Last Day. At that time, a soft wind will cause every believer to die. In Sahih Muslim, Amr ibn Al-Aas narrated that the Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \"Then Allah will raise a wind whose smell is similar to musk and whose touch is similar to silk. It will cause any person who has the weight of a seed of faith in his heart to die. Then only the evilest people will remain and the Hour will come upon them.\" This indicates that Islam's nation will not be deprived of the truth at any time. The truth will be passed and handed down from one generation to another until Jesus, son of Mary, descends, kills the Antichrist, and follows Prophet Muhammad's legislation, which is the final law to the day of Resurrection. It is clarified in the rest of the hadith when that believed group's leader would say to Prophet Jesus, \u201cCome and lead us in prayer.\u201d Prophet Jesus would decline and explain, \"No, some of you are commanders over some of you as an honor from Allah for this nation.\" In Musnad Ahmad, Jaber narrated \u201cIt will be said to him, 'Come forward, O spirit of Allah God!' He will answer, 'Let your imam come forward and lead you in prayer.'\" As for Prophet Jesus' abandoning leading them in prayer despite his prophethood, it was said that he would do that lest it was thought that the Prophet Muhammad's legislation was abrogated by his descending. It is the remaining law until the Last Day. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It proves the Prophet Muhammad's prophethood, (2) It confirms Prophet Jesus' descent and his following the Prophet Muhammad's legislation, (3) It shows the virtue of following the Prophet Muhammad's Sunnah, for the mentioned group was granted victory and steadfastness in resisting enemies by following his Sunnah, (4) It shows the virtue of the Muslim nation that Allah saved it from agreeing on misguidance, so it will remain as a believing group until the Last Day.."}, {"number": 54, "hadith": "Abu Huraira narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u201cThe last hour (of worldly life) will not come before wealth becomes abundant and overflowing to the extent that a man goes out with his zakat but does not find anyone accepts it from him and the land of Arab reverts to be meadows and rivers.\u201d.", "commentary": "The Prophet (\ufdfa) used to tell his companions about the events and signs of the Day of Resurrection and affairs of the end of this worldly life that only Allah knows. Thus, he did that to teach and make them prepare themselves for this great day. In this hadith, he informed us about one of the signs that precede this day. Most people will become rich to the extent that they no longer need the money they have so none will need or accept the zakat. The rich will strive to find a poor person who needs or accepts their zakat with no vein. Another narration in the two Sahihs says, \u201cUntil the owner of the money becomes concerned, for none will accept his zakat and the person to whom he will give it will reply, 'I am not in need of it.'\" It means either they no longer need the money for their being rich or they become busy with the hereafter away from this worldly life, content with their daily sustenance, and do not save money. The Prophet (\ufdfa) also confirmed that the last hour will not come until the Arabian Peninsula becomes meadows and rivers as before. A meadow is a wide land with fresh abundant water and lots of grass where the animals frolic. He meant that the Arabs would cultivate and revive their lands by flowing rivers, planting trees, and sowing grains, away from their usual life of moving from one place to another searching for pasture. Finally, this hadith shows one of the signs that prove his prophethood.."}, {"number": 55, "hadith": "Abu Huraira narrated, \u201cThe Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u2018When three things appear, no soul will benefit from its faith as long as it did not believe before or earn some good through its faith: Sun\u2019s rising from its place of setting, the Dajjal, and the beast of the earth.\u2019\u201d.", "commentary": "The hereafter has minor and major signs. The major ones are little, consecutive, closer to Hereafter, and none of them have occurred yet while the minor ones are many, distant in between, and lots of them have occurred so far. In this hadith, the Prophet (\ufdfa) told us about three major ones. At that time, repentance will not benefit the one who has not previously repented, faith will not benefit a disbeliever, and performing righteous deeds will not benefit a negligent person. As a result, the Prophet urged us to perform righteous deeds to increase our faith before the three following signs: (1) The Sun's rise from the West, (2) The emergence of the Dajjal (the antichrist). The word Dajjal is derived from \"dajal\" which means covering. He is called Dajjal, for he covers the truth with his falsehood. He is a human that Allah will send to test His servants. He will be granted miracles like killing then reviving the dead, having the means to pleasure and enjoyment, having his Paradise, Hell, and two rivers, the earth's treasures will follow him, his command the heavens to rain so it rains, and the earth to sprout so it sprouts. All these miracles will happen by Allah's power and will, and (3) The animal of the earth: It will clearly distinguish between believers and disbelievers when people's hearts corrupt, abandon Allah's commands, and change the true religion. It will emerge in Mecca or another place. In Musnad Ahmad, Abu Omamah Al-Bahely narrated that the Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \u201cThe animal will come out and label people's noses.\" Allah said about it, \"And when the word befalls them, We will bring forth for them a creature from the earth speaking to them, [saying] that the people were, of Our verses, not certain [in faith].\" (An-Naml: 82) It will act like this with Allah's ability who will make it able to speak to people with words they will understand. The apparent meaning of this hadith confirms that Allah will not accept sinners' repentance when all these three signs rise. On the other hand, there is a hadith in Sahih Muslim showing that the first sign is the Sun's rise from the West. In the Two Sahihs, the Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \"The Hour will not be established until the sun rises from the West. When the people see it, all living on it (the earth) will believe (in Allah). It will be when \"... no soul will benefit from its faith as long as it had not believed before ...\" (Al-An'am: 158) This indicates that people's repentance will not be accepted when this sign emerges. Thus, the hadith may mean that these three signs will closely emerge as the Prophet said, in Sahih Muslim, about the signs of the Sun\u2019s rise and the animal, \u201cwhich of the two happens first, the second one would follow immediately after that.\u201d The Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It shows the Prophet's care about advising his nation, (2) It clarifies how the Last Day's signs will have horrible effects on people, especially those three signs, and (3) It confirms the Prophet's prophethood.."}, {"number": 56, "hadith": "Ibn Abbas narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa passed through the valley of Al-Azraq and asked, \u2018Which valley is this?\u2019 They said, \u2018This is the valley of Al-Azraq.\u2019 He added, \u2018(I perceive) as if I am seeing Moses coming down from the mountain track and loudly calling Allah with talbeya (saying, \u2018Here I am! at your service!\u2019).\u2019 Then he (the Prophet \ufdfa) came to the mountain track of Harsha and asked, \u2018Which is this mountain track?\u2019 They said, \u2018It is the mountain track of Harsha.\u2019 He added, \u2018(I perceive) as If I am seeing Yunus (Jonah), the son of Matta, riding a well-built she-camel, wearing a cloak of wool, and calling Allah with talbeya.

Allah informed his prophets of the rite of pilgrimage as Prophet Ibrahim's call. In this hadith, Abdullah ibn Abbas narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa passed through the valley of Al-Azraq in Hijaz, about 100 km to the north-east of Mecca, between Mecca and Medina. When he asked his companion about its name, they answered, \u201cThe valley of Al-Azraq.\u201d He said that it was as if he was seeing Prophet Moses coming down from the mountain track while loudly calling Allah with saying talbeya (here I am! At your service!) In another narration in Sahih Muslim, he said, \u201cIt is as if I can see Musa - and he mentioned something about his color and hair - while placing his two fingers in his ears and loudly calling Allah with talbeya.\u201d Then, the Prophet \ufdfa came to the mountain track of Harsha which was a mountain located at the crossroad of Medina and Levant. When he asked his companions about its name, they answered, \u201cIt is the mountain track of Harsha.\u201d He said, \u201cIt is as if I am seeing Yunus (Jonah), the son of Matta, riding a well-built she-camel, wearing a cloak of wool, and calling Allah with talbeya. The rein of his she-camel is made of the fibers of date palm.\u201d These events may be explained by one of the following possibilities: (1) Either the Prophet \ufdfa saw them during his journey of Al-Isra\u2019, (2) He dreamed of all of these events, or (3) He related what those prophets did in their life as Allah revealed to him. This hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It confirms that pilgrimage is Allah\u2019s and His Prophets' rites, (2) It encourages Muslims to perform this great rite, (3) It urges Muslims to loudly call Allah with talbeya which indicates Allah\u2019s oneness, (4) A Muslim is recommended to say talbeya when ascending or descending, (5) The state of ihram expresses impartiality to Allah, and (6) Declaring the oneness of Allah is recommended when passing through low valleys as the Prophets did.."}, {"number": 57, "hadith": "Jaber narrated that the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said, \"The Prophets were presented to me.

He saw some prophets presented to him, either in real life, as souls, during a dream, or during the Journey of ascension as the other narration in the two Sahihs clarified. He showed that Prophet Moses (\ufdfa) was thin and tall like the people of Uzd Shanou'a, a Yamani tribe. He likened Prophet Jesus (\ufdfa) with the companion Urwa ibn Mas'oud Ath-Thaqafy. He was one of the Meccan leaders who contributed to make the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah. In the narration of Bukhari, the Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \u201cAs for Jesus, he was red, curly, and broad-chested.\u201d The Prophet (\ufdfa) saw Prophet Ibrahim (\ufdfa) who was the closest one in resemblance to him. He also saw Gabriel, the angel, who was entrusted with conveying revelation to prophets. The closest one in resemblance to him was the companion Dehya ibn Khalifa Al-Kalby. He was one of the most handsome people who was responsible for meeting kings. Gabriel, the Angel, used to come to the Prophet (\ufdfa) in Dehya's appearance. The Prophet (\ufdfa) saw Gabriel, the Angel, in his real form as Abdullah ibn Mas'oud narrated in the two Sahihs that the Prophet (\ufdfa) saw Gabriel with six hundred wings.."}, {"number": 58, "hadith": "Abdullah ibn Omar narrated, \u201cThe Messenger of Allah \ufdfa stood up among the people, praised Allah as He deserved, mentioned the Dajjal (Antichrist), and then said, \u2018Verily, I warn you against him. No Prophet did not warn his people against him. (Even) Noah warned his people against him, but I will tell you something about him that no Prophet told his people about. You have to know that he is one-eyed while Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is not one-eyed.\u2019\u201d.", "commentary": "The Prophet (\ufdfa) used to mention some events and great tribulations that would happen before the Day of Resurrection and guided people on how to act and protect themselves from them. In this hadith, Abdullah ibn Omar narrated that the Prophet (\ufdfa) once addressed them and praised Allah with the attributes he deserved then warned them against the Antichrist\u2019s evilness and trials of covering the truthful with his falsehood. He is a great sign of the hereafter with whom Allah will test his servants. He is a human to whom Allah will give divine powers such as: (1) Reviving a person he has just murdered, (2) His command of the heaven to rain and earth to bring forth fruit, (3) His paradise and hell, and (4) His two rivers. All these miracles will happen by Allah\u2019s will. The Prophet (\ufdfa) warned his nation against his temptations as all previous prophets did, for none of them knew the time of his advent. The benefit of this warning is to believe in his existence, be keen to take him as an enemy, show his disbelief, and sincerely turn to Allah to seek His refuge from his temptation. Even the Prophet Noah, the first Prophet, warned his nation against him. Based on Allah\u2019s revelation to him, the Prophet (\ufdfa) said to his companions that he would inform them about the Antichrist\u2019s matters that none of the previous prophets informed their people. He told them that he was a one-eyed person with a protruding eye while the right one was flat, as narrated by Ibn Omar in the Two Sahihs. Having one eye is an attribute of deficiency so the Prophet (\ufdfa) proved Allah\u2019s perfect attributes and alerted the people of heedless minds that whoever had a defect in himself could not be a god. Whoever is disabled to correct his deficiency is more disabled to benefit or harm others. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It proves the Prophet\u2019s message, (2) The Prophet \ufdfa shows some of the Antichrist\u2019s attributes to make his nation beware of him, (3) It shows how the Prophet \ufdfa has deep compassion with his nation, (4) It proves Allah\u2019s attribute of sight in the manner that befits Him without any type of negation or resembling Him to any of His creation, and (5) It proves the absolute perfection of Allah\u2019s attributes.."}, {"number": 59, "hadith": "Abu Huraira narrated, \u201cThe Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u2018When I was in Hejr, Qureish asked me about my journey of Isra\u2019. They asked me about some details of Bait Al-Maqdes which I could not recall. It was the most severe distress that I had ever felt. Thus, Allah raised it (Bait Al-Maqdes) before my eyes so I could see it. I told them about anything they were asking me. (During the journey) I met a group of prophets. I saw Moses praying. He was a thin man with curly hair as if he was a man from the tribe of Shanou\u2019a. I saw Jesus, the son of Mary \ufdfa praying. The closest one in resemblance to him was Urwah ibn Masoud Ath-Thaqafy. I saw Ibrahim praying. The closest one in resemblance to him is your companion (the Prophet himself). When it was the time of prayer, I led them. When I completed the prayer, someone said, \u2018O Muhammad, here is Malik, the keeper of Hell. Greet him.\u2019 When I turned to him, he started to greet me.\u2019\u201d.", "commentary": "The journey of the Isra and Me\u2019raj was one of the miracles with which Allah supported His Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa. He honored and ascended him with Gabriel, the Angel, to the highest heaven so he saw Allah\u2019s Paradise along with His greatest signs. In this hadith, the Prophet \ufdfa told us that he once stood at Al-Hejr, a place surrounded by a low wall next to the Kaaba where Qureish leaders used to meet, they asked him to describe Bait Al-Maqdis that he visited during his journey from the Sacred Mosque to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, for they wanted to confirm his truth of traveling there. They knew that he had not traveled to that place ever since. Indeed, the Prophet \ufdfa was not concerned with deeply observing all those details. He was busy with lots of things that were more important. He was anxious and distressed that he could not recall those details. As a result, Allah materialized the mosque before his eyes so he could answer all their questions. Additionally, he told us that he saw some prophets like Prophet Moses. In Sahih Muslim, he said, \u201cI passed by Prophet Moses who was praying in his grave.\u201d The Prophet Moses was a thin tall man with curly hair and swarthy skin as if he were from the tribe of Shanou\u2019a, a Yemeni tribe from Qahtan area known for its tall people. The Prophet \ufdfa also saw Prophet Jesus, son of Mary, praying. The closest one in resemblance to him was the Prophet\u2019s companion Urwah ibn Masoud Ath-Thaqafy who effectively contributed to ratify Treaty of Hudaybeya. In a narration in Sahih Bukhari, he said, \u201cAs for Jesus, he was red, curly, and broad-chested.\u201d The Prophet \ufdfa saw Prophet Ibrahim praying. The closest one in resemblance to him was the Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa himself. When meeting the prophets and the time for prayer began, he led them in prayer. If someone asks, \u201cHow did he see Moses praying in his grave and then saw him in his rank in the high heavens?\u201d The answer is that all these story\u2019s details are beyond our imagination. It is Allah\u2019s act, the One, the Almighty. He is even capable of doing more than that. Thus, we believe that he saw Moses praying in his grave, he led all prophets in Bait Al-Maqdes in prayer, and they welcomely received him during his ascending to a heaven after a heaven. After completing his prayer, someone said to him (apparently Gabriel, the Angel), \u201cO Muhammad, this is Malek, the keeper of Hell.\u201d He is one of the angels. He (apparently Gabriel) asked the Prophet \ufdfa to greet Malek, but Malek greeted him first. This hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It showed the Prophet\u2019s virtue and status that Allah granted him, and (2) It clarified how Allah cared and provided his Prophet \ufdfa with clear evidence.."}, {"number": 60, "hadith": "Abdullah ibn Masoud narrated, \u201cWhen the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa was taken on the Night Journey, he came to Sidrat Al-Muntaha which was in the sixth heaven. That was where everything that ascended from the earth ended and was held there, and where everything that descended from above ended and was held there. Allah said, \u201cWhen that covered the lote tree which did cover it.\u201d (An-Najm: 16) It meant butterflies of gold. The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa was given three things: The five daily prayers, the last verses of Surat Al-Baqarah, and forgiving grave sins of whoever from his nation dying without associating anything with Allah.\u201d.", "commentary": "The journey of the Isra and Me\u2019raj was one of the miracles with which Allah supported His Prophet \ufdfa. It happened in the tenth year of the Prophet's mission. He was taken on a journey from the Sacred Mosque in Mecca to Bait Al-Maqdes in Palestine. Then, Allah honoured and took him up with Gabriel, the angel, to the highest heavens to see Paradise along with other greatest signs. In this hadith, Abdullah ibn Masoud narrated that when the Prophet \ufdfa passed the seven heavens, he reached Sidrat Al-Muntaha (Tree of End) which was a great tree where humankind knew nothing above it. He is Allah who knows what is above. It is a phase to where all human deeds ascend and all Allah's commands descend. Then both commands and deeds are conveyed to the next phase. In a narration in Sahih Muslim, the Prophet \ufdfa said, \u201cNone of Allah's creation can describe it, due to its beauty.\u201d Imam Ahmad narrated the same expression, but he added that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \"It turned into a ruby or an emerald.\u201d The narration we explained here showed that this tree was after the sixth heaven, but Anas narrated in the Two Sahihs that the Prophet \ufdfa mentioned that it was after the seventh heaven. More narrators reported the second hadith, so it had preference. After Ibn Masoud recited the Quranic verse, \u201cWhen that covered the lote tree which did cover it,\u201d (An-Najm:16), he clarified that it was surrounded and covered with butterflies of gold that were between the tree and the Prophet \ufdfa. Upon reaching this tree, the Prophet \ufdfa was given three things: (1) The five obligatory prayers. They were fifty but Allah reduced them to be five as an act of worship and fifty as for their reward, (2) The last two virtuous verses of Surat Al-Baqarah. In Sahih Muslim, Ibn Abbas reported, \"While Gabriel was sitting with the Prophet \ufdfa, he heard a creaking sound above him. He lifted his head and said, 'It is a gate opened in heaven today which had never been opened before.' Then an angel descended through it. Gabriel said, 'This is an angel coming down to the earth who never came down before.' The angel greeted and said, 'O Muhammad, receive the glad tidings of two lights given to you which were not given to any prophet before. They were Surat Al-Fatihah and the last verses of Surat Al-Baqarah. You will never recite a letter from it, but you will be given it (its reward).'\" So, Allah had given them to the Prophet \ufdfa in this journey then were revealed to him in Medina, and (3) Allah promised to forgive the great sins committed by anyone of the Prophet's nation if he died while believing in the oneness of Allah without associating partners with Him. The mentioned sins are those ruin their doers and lead them to Hell. The Islamic proofs confirm that whoever commits great sins then dies before repentance will be held accountable for it, but he will not be punished in Hell eternally, unlike the polytheists. Thus, the hadith does not mean that they will not be punished at all. It is said that the hadith refers to some of the Prophet\u2019s nation, so Allah will forgive all major or minor sins of some of the nation, except for polytheism, for He said, \u201cVerily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives, except that, anything else to whom He wills.\u201d (An-Nisa: 48) As a result, the destiny of those died without repenting from major sins is entrusted to Allah who may punish or forgive them. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It describes the Tree of End, (2) It shows how Allah dignifies his Prophet \ufdfa and his nation, and (3) It explains the virtue of the five daily prayers which were prescribed above the seven heavens, unlike other obligatory acts.."}, {"number": 61, "hadith": "As for Allah's saying, \"And he certainly saw him in another descent.\" (An-Najm: 13), Abu Hurairah said, \"He saw Gabriel, the Angel.\".", "commentary": "The journey of the Isra and Mi\u2019raj was one of the miracles with which Allah supported His Prophet Muhammad (\ufdfa). He honored and ascended him with Gabriel, the Angel, to the highest heavens so he saw Paradise along with His greatest signs. In this hadith, Abu Hurairah interpreted Allah's saying, \"And he certainly saw him in another descent.\" (An-Najm: 13) and said that was the second time the Prophet saw Gabriel, the Angel, in his real form. The first time was at the beginning of his prophethood when Gabriel filled the sky's horizon, so he did not mean he saw his God. Some scholars think he saw his God with his heart, not his eyes, based on a hadith in Sahih Muslim reported by Ibn Abbas. They said that Allah granted his heart a sight so that he could see Him with his heart as if he saw Him with his eyes. It was also said that Allah firmed his heart so he could realize what he would see with his eyes. It was narrated in Sahih Muslim that Abu Dharr said, \"I asked the Prophet (\ufdfa), 'Have you seen your God?' The Prophet said, 'I saw a light.'\" This Prophetic expression may mean that he saw Allah's light or another light that prevented him from seeing Allah, as in another Muslim narration in which Abu Dharr reported that the Prophet said, \"A light. How can see Him?!\" He meant that he saw a veil of light prevented him from seeing Allah. The Companions and the scholars after them differed on that. Some confirmed it while others negated it. It was said that it is most likely that he saw his God, but they differed on how he saw Him. Some confirmed it was with heart while others confirmed it was with eyes.."}, {"number": 62, "hadith": "As for Allah's saying, \"The heart did not lie [about] what it saw.\" (An-Najm: 11) and \"And he certainly saw him in another descent.\" (An-Najm: 11), Ibn Abbas said, \"He saw him by his heart twice.\".", "commentary": "The journey of the Isra and Mi\u2019raj was one of the miracles with which Allah supported His Prophet Muhammad (\ufdfa). He honored and ascended him with Gabriel, the Angel, to the highest heavens so he saw Paradise along with His greatest signs. In this hadith, Ibn Abbas interpreted Allah's saying, \"The heart did not lie [about] what it saw.\" (An-Najm: 11) that the Prophet's heart did not lie about seeing his God. It was a real vision. He also interpreted Allah's saying, \"And he certainly saw him in another descent.\" (An-Najm: 13) that the Prophet (\ufdfa) saw his God with his heart, as in another narration in Sahih Muslim. It was said that Allah granted his heart a sight so that he could see Him with his heart as if he saw Him with his eyes or He firmed his heart so he could realize what he would see with his eyes. On the contrary, Abu Hurairah narrated in Sahih Muslim that the one who was seen was Gabriel, the Angel. In Sahih Muslim, Abu Dharr said, \"I asked the Prophet, 'Have you seen your God?' The Prophet said, 'I saw a light.'\" This Prophetic expression may mean that he saw Allah's light or another light that prevented him from seeing Allah, as in another Muslim narration in which Abu Dharr reported that the Prophet said, \"A light.

It was also said that Allah firmed his heart so he could realize what he would see with his eyes. This contradicts another hadith in Sahih Muslim reported by Abu Hurairah that the one who was seen is Gabriel, the Angel, in his real shape. As a result, Abu Hurairah narrated, as in Sahih Muslim, that, \"Abu Dharr said, 'I asked the Prophet, 'Have you seen your God?'

And you feared the people, while Allah has more right that you fear Him.\u2019\u201d (Al-Ahzab: 37).", "commentary": "The Prophet Muhammad completely reported what Allah revealed to him. He was too trustworthy to conceal anything of the Quran. In this hadith, Aisha, Mother of the Believers, told us that if he, as a reliable person, had wanted to conceal any verse of the Quran, he would have concealed this verse, \"And [remember, O Muhammad], when you said to the one on whom Allah bestowed favor and you bestowed favor, 'Keep your wife and fear Allah,' while you concealed within yourself that which Allah is to disclose. And you feared the people, while Allah has more right that you fear Him. So when Zaid had no longer any need for her, We married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have need of them. And ever is the command of Allah accomplished.\" (Al-Ahzab: 37) Allah reproached him and expressed what he concealed. The Prophet advised his companion Zaid ibn Haritha not to divorce Zainab bint Jahsh although Allah had informed him that Zaid would divorce her and he, the Prophet, would marry her afterward. The Islamic rule is that a Muslim cannot marry his son's wife or ex-wife. The Prophet adopted Zaid ibn Haritha to the extent that the latter was called Zaid ibn Muhammad. Allah wanted to abort the habit of adoption so He revealed to him that Zaid would divorce her and he, the Prophet, had to marry her to abort this habit, confirming that Zaid was not the Prophet's son. The Prophet (\ufdfa) wanted to conceal these details lest the hypocrites may have accused him of marrying Zaid\u2019s ex-wife although he prohibited this habit ahead. All of these divine procedures were for great wisdom as Allah stated, \"... in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have need of them....\" As a result, when Zaid complained to the Prophet about her, the Prophet advised him to keep her in spite of his previous knowledge of the details that Allah showed to him. The favor that Allah bestowed upon Zaid is Islam and the favor that the Prophet bestowed upon Zaid is emancipation. Allah blamed His Prophet for his trying to avoid people's blaming and saying: He commanded his son to divorce his wife so he could marry her afterward. Allah guided His Prophet that He has more right that he fears Him. It was not meant that the Prophet did not fear Allah while fearing people but it was meant that the Prophet feared people's comments while fearing Allah at the same time. It was not a sin, for Allah did not command him to ask His forgiveness.  In fact, an act may not be a sin but there is another better act. A Muslim may be excused for some confusing matters that occur in his heart as long as he does not mean to commit a sin. The Prophet hid these details for fear that people would be confused about the above Islamic rule about adoption. Finally, the hadith confirmed that the Prophet is a human who has human attributes.."}, {"number": 65, "hadith": "Abdullah ibn Shaqiq said, \u201cI said to Abu Dharr, \u2018Had I seen the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa, I would have asked him.\u2019 He (Abu Dharr) asked, \u2018What is that thing about which you would have asked him?\u2019 He said, \u2018I would have asked him, \u2018Had you seen your Lord?\u2019 Abu Dharr said, \u2018In fact, I asked him and he replied, \u2018I saw light.\u2019\u201d.", "commentary": "The journey of the Isra and Mi\u2019raj was one of the miracles with which Allah supported His Prophet Muhammad (\ufdfa).

When Abu Dharr asked his explanation, Abdullah told him that he had wanted to ask the Prophet if he had seen his God. Abu Dharr confirmed that he had asked the Prophet the same question so the Prophet replied, \"I saw light.\" This means that he saw nothing from Allah but light. Allah's light is a light befitting Him, without any interpretation. It was said that the light he saw was nothing but the veil between Allah and His servants, for Abu Musa Al-Ash\u2019ary reported in Sahih Muslim that the Prophet said, \"His veil is the light. If he were to remove it, the glory of his face would burn all of his creation, as far as his sight reaches.\" His sight is endless. The Companions and the scholars after them differed on that. Some confirmed it while others negated it. It was said that it is most likely that he saw Him but they differed on how he saw Him. Some confirmed it was with heart while others confirmed it was with eyes. Finally, this hadith clarifies that the Prophet saw His God with his heart.."}, {"number": 66, "hadith": "Abu Musa narrated, \u201cThe Messenger of Allah \ufdfa stood up among us and said five things, \u2018Verily, Allah, the Almighty, does not sleep and it does not befit him to sleep. He lowers the scale and raises it. The deed done during the night is taken up to Him before the deed done during the day, and the deed done during the day before the deed done during the night. His veil is the light (\u201cthe fire\u201d as in another narration). If He were to remove it, the glory of his Face would burn everything of His creation as far as His gaze reaches.\u2019\u201d.", "commentary": "The Prophet \ufdfa used to choose suitable times to preach to his companions, remind them about Allah periodically, and teach them Allah\u2019s unmatchable attributes. In this hadith, the companion Abu Musa Al-Ash\u2019ary narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa once delivered his companions five Islamic teachings. He told them that Allah never slept, for it was not appropriate for Him to sleep. Sleeping is an attribute of deficiency, which is impossible to be his attribute. Allah said, \u201cNeither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him.\u201d (Al-Baqarah: 255). Additionally, how does the Manager of the heavens and the earth sleep?! The Prophet \ufdfa also told them that Allah possessed the scale of justice and provisions, so he restricted or expanded his bliss to his servants, out of his comprehensive wisdom. Also, the Prophet \ufdfa informed them that his servant\u2019s righteous or evil deeds done during the night were taken up to Him before those done during the day and vice versa. This indicates that all deeds are immediately raised to Him by His angels, without waiting for the day or night to be completed. There is no doubt that he knows all of these deeds before they are even taken up to Him. As a result, if a servant realizes this, he has to fear and take much care of Allah\u2019s observation during the day and night. Also, the Prophet \ufdfa informed them that there was a barrier between Allah and His creation which was the light or fire as in the other narration. There is no contradiction between the two words, for Allah called the lamp\u2019s fire as light as in Surat An-Nour, unlike the dark fire of Hell, Allah forbid, which was not called a light. If Allah were to remove that veil, His face\u2019s glory would burn everything of His creation as far as His gaze reaches. Allah\u2019s sight is endless. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) The humans cannot see Allah in this world, but Allah will honor whomever He wishes with this bliss in the Hereafter, (2) It proves the veil between Allah and his creation, in the way that befits him, without negating its meaning or comparing it with his creation\u2019s attributes, (3) It proves some of Allah\u2019s attributes such as: the face, sight, raising and lowering of the scale of justice, in the way that befits him, (4) It is impossible for Allah to sleep, for it is an attribute of deficiency, and (5) It proves that the servants\u2019 deeds are submitted to Allah every day and every night.."}, {"number": 67, "hadith": "Suhaib narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \u201cWhen the people of Paradise enter it, Allah, the Most-High, asks them, \u2018Do you wish Me to give you anything more?\u2019 They answer, \u2018Have You not brightened our faces? Have You not made us enter Paradise and saved us from Hell?\u2019 Then the veil is lifted so they are not given something dearer to them than seeing their Lord, the Most-High.\u2019\u201d In another narration, \u201cThen he (the Prophet) recited this verse, \u2018For them who have done good is the best [reward] and extra.\u2019\u201d (Yunus: 26).", "commentary": "Paradise is Allah's reward for His pious and faithful servants. Whoever wins Paradise after experiencing the horror of the Last Day knows the extent of Allah's grace upon him. However, He, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, provides his servants with another blessing. In this hadith, the Prophet told us that after the people of Paradise entered it, Allah would ask them as a prelude to a coming blessing, \"Do you wish Me to give you anything more?\u201d They would answer, \"Have You not brightened our faces?\" They referred to the verse, \"But as for those whose faces will turn white, [they will be] within the mercy of Allah. They will abide therein eternally.\" (Aal-Imran: 107) They resumed, \"Have You not made us enter Paradise and saved us from Hell?\" Whitening their faces, granting them satisfaction, admitting them to Paradise, and saving them from Hell were their ultimate hope, but Allah's blessings are endless. Afterward, he would clear the veil of light in between so they could clearly see him, as stated in a hadith narrated by Imam Muslim. They did not imagine that there was not a blessing over entering Paradise so Allah would fulfill His promise and grant them the greatest blessing, as the Prophet said, \"Indeed, you will see your God ...\" (Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim) They would not be given something dearer to them than seeing their God, the Most-High. In another narration, the Prophet \u201crecited this verse, 'For them who have done good is the best [reward] and extra.'\" (Yunus: 26) The \"best\" is their entering Paradise and the \"extra\" is their looking at their God, as Allah said, \"[Some] faces, that Day, will be radiant, looking at their Lord.\" (Al-Qiyaama: 22, 23) So, he made it clear that the reward of those preferring Hereafter to the worldly life is to make their faces beautiful at that time. Additionally, they will enjoyably and clearly look at their God's unmatchable dazzling beauty.

I will not ask you something else.\u2019 He said, \u2018O son of Adam, did not you promise me not to ask Me for anything else?

In this hadith, the Prophet (\ufdfa) related the story of the last person to enter Paradise. On his way to Paradise and during his walking over the bridge over Hell, he will sometimes walk, and fall on his face, out of fear and panic that he may fall into it. Sometimes, he will be scorched by Hell. Once crossing it, he will turn to it and say, \u2018Blessed was He Who saved me from you.\u2019 He will think that Allah gave him something that He did not give to anyone earlier or later. Afterward, he will not be satisfied with the bliss he would be granted but desire for more of Allah\u2019s generosity. In the meanwhile, Allah will raise a tree for him so he will bring him near it, aiming to enjoy its shade and water. Allah will say to him, \u201cO son of Adam, if I grant you this, will you ask Me for something else?\u2019 The man will promise not to ask Him for anything else. Allah will excuse him because he sees something he cannot resist its temptation. Once again, a more beautiful tree will be raised for him and the same literal story will repeat. In the third time, Allah will raise for him a tree that will be more beautiful than the first two but this time it will be at Paradise\u2019s gate. The same dialogue will repeat and Allah will bring him there. Once he enjoys this tree\u2019s shade and hears the voices of the people of Paradise while enjoying its bliss and speaking to their wives and companions, he will ask Allah to admit him into Paradise. Thus, Allah will ask him, and He knows best, to clarify what makes him satisfied after these frequently fulfilled requests. Thereupon, Allah will promise to grant him the entire world and a like one along with it. Out of surprise and joy, the man will say, \u201cAre You mocking me although You are the God of the worlds?!\u201d At this point, Ibn Mas\u2019oud laughed and imitated the Prophet\u2019s laughter due to Allah\u2019s laughter at this man\u2019s expression. Allah\u2019s laughter is different from people\u2019s laughter, for it is a laughter that befits His perfection and majesty. Then, Allah will confirm that he does not mock but will fulfill His promise, for He is All-Powerful and nothing may deduct his dominion.

Once clarifying all of his desires, Allah will promise to grant him this entire world with its tenfold. Then, he will enter his house in Paradise with his two wide-eyed wives with very white cornea and very dark pupils. They will say, \u201cPraise be to Allah Who created you for us and created us for you.\u201d Due to that huge bliss, he will think that he lives in the highest rank in Paradise. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) People of monotheism will be temporarily punished in Hell and be admitted into Paradise when Allah wills, (2) It clarifies Paradise\u2019s huge bliss in comparison to this worldly bliss, for the man who is in the lowest rank in Paradise will get the double of this entire worldly bliss, and (3) It urges people to frequently perform righteous deeds to get that bliss of Paradise.."}, {"number": 69, "hadith": "Al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said, \"The Prophet (\ufdfa) Musa asked his God, 'Who is the lowest in rank among the people of Paradise?'

The reward is of the same type as the work.

I and my nation will be over a hill.\u201d Imam At-Tabary mentioned in his explanation of the Quran that Ibn Umar said, \u201cHe and his nation will rise over a hill above the people.\u201d Jaber told that all nations would be called on that day along with the idols they worshipped, as a sign of shame and humiliation. On that day, they would bitterly regret when knowing they were false gods without any benefit. As for the believers, Jaber told that they only followed Allah so they would be waiting their God to follow. Allah would come to them in a way befitting his majesty and asked them about whom they were waiting for. They would answer Him that there were waiting for their God. Once He informed them that he was their God, they would ask Him to for looking at His noble face to recognize Him, as described to them in the Quran and Prophetic tradition. He would manifest Himself smiling to them in a way befitting Himself then go with them. Every person, a hypocrite or a believer, would be granted a light to follow. As for the believer, his light would be according to his faith in Allah, but the hypocrite would be deceived with an unrealistic light as he did with the believers in the world by displaying his faith. All would follow their lights until reaching the bridge over Hell. There would be spikes and hooks on that bridge to catch whom Allah willed. At that hard time, the hypocrites\u2019 light would be extinguished as a recompense to their hypocrisy but the believers would be saved. The hypocrites would not be able to cross the bridge because of the hooks throwing them into Hell. The faces of the first believing saved group would be like the full bright moon, out of Allah\u2019s grace. They would be seventy thousand who would not be held accountable out of their prestige with Allah, for all of their deeds were acceptable. The faces of the second believing saved group would be like the brightest star in heaven, which had less light. The rest of people would cross according to their deeds. Later, Allah would allow people to intercede. The Prophets, angels, and the believers would intercede with Allah to get people out of Hell. The intercessors would be interceding even for he who declared, \u2018There is no god but Allah\u2019 while having goodness in his heart like the weight of a barley grain, which was a sign of Allah\u2019s mercy to His servants. They would be saved from Hell and brought to a wide place in Paradise. The people of Paradise would start to sprinkle water over them. Their burned bodies would be healed and sprout like a little plant due to the flood water. Ibn Masoud narrated in the Two Sahihs that the Prophet showed that one of them would ask for Allah\u2019s bounties of Paradise. As a result, Allah would grant him the entire world along with ten doubles. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It proves some attributes to Allah like laughter, coming, and manifestation, (2) It proves the believers\u2019 seeing their God on the Day of Resurrection, (3) It proves intercession, (4) Paradise exists now, and (5) The believers will get rid of hypocrites on that day.."}, {"number": 72, "hadith": "Yazid al-Faqir said, \"I was admired by an opinion of Khawarij. I set out in a large group intending to perform pilgrimage, then declare that to people. We passed by Medina and found Jaber ibn Abdullah ( sitting against a pillar and narrating the Prophet's hadiths to people. When Jaber mentioned the people of Hell, I said, 'O the Prophet's companion, how are you narrating that although Allah said, '\u201cOur Lord! Verily, whom You admit to the Fire, indeed, You have disgraced him\" (Aal-Imran: 192) and \"Every time they wish to get away therefrom, they will be put back thereto.\" (As-Sajda: 20)? Jaber asked me, 'Did you read the Quran?' I answered, 'Yes.\" He asked, 'Did you hear about the exalted position of the Prophet Muhammad (i.e. in the hereafter)?' I answered, 'Yes.' He said, 'Verily, it is the Prophet Muhammad's position through which Allah will bring out (from Hell) whomsoever He wants.' Then, he described the bridge and passing people over it. I am afraid I may not have remembered so but he claimed that Allah would get some people out of Hell. They would get out of it as if they were the wood of the ebony tree. Then, they would bathe in a river in Paradise and get out as if they were papers. We then asked ourselves, 'Woe be upon you! How can you think that this old man tells a lie against the Messenger of Allah?\u2019 We all left that (doctrine of Khawarij) except one man..", "commentary": "Paradise is the house of eternal reward that Allah made for His pious and faithful servants. Whoever wins Paradise after experiencing the horror of the Last Day knows the extent of Allah's grace upon him. He is the Most Generous, the Most Merciful that bestows His blessings and rewards upon His servants and increases their blessings and dignity. In this hadith, Yazid Al-Faqir (a companion of the Prophet's companions) narrated that he admired an opinion of the Kharijites. They are one of the sects of heresies with whom Muslims are afflicted. Although they are frequently practicing Islamic rites, they think that some Muslims are infidels and will eternally remain in Hell due to their committing major sins. Thus, they do not hesitate to shed their blood. This is a false doctrine that contradicts the Quran and the Sunnah. Yazid traveled with a large group from Kufa to Mecca to perform pilgrimage and call people to this misleading doctrine. On their way to Mecca, they passed by Medina and found Jaber ibn Abdullah sitting against a pillar and narrating the Prophet's hadiths to people. Jaber confirmed that some people would initially get into Hell due to their sins, and then get out after being punished. Allah would admit them to Paradise with His mercy. They would be in the lowest status in Paradise. Yazid refused and confirmed to Jaber that this doctrine of proving intercession contradicted Quranic verses like: \u201cOur Lord! Verily, whom You admit to the Fire, indeed, You have disgraced him\" (Aal-Imran: 192) and \"Every time they wish to get away therefrom, they will be put back thereto.\" (As-Sajda: 20) Afterward, Jaber asked him, \"Did you read the Qur\u2019an?\u201d Yazid replied, \"Yes.\" Jaber asked him if he heard about the Prophet's exalted position that Allah would grant him in the hereafter as in Allah's truthful promise in the Quran, \"It may be that your Lord will raise you to a\u2009station of praise.\" (Al-Isra: 79) It is his status of great intercession for which all people will praise him. Yazid replied, \"Yes.\" Jaber told him that it would be his status of intercession through which Allah would bring out from Hell whomever He wants. Afterward, Jaber described the bridge over Hell through which people would cross it. Yazid was afraid that he may have forgotten some of Jaber's words about the bridge, but he confirmed that Jaber claimed that some people, due to Allah's mercy, would get out of Hell as if they were the wood of the ebony tree, i.e. black, bathe in a river in Paradise, then get out as if they were thick white papers, preparing themselves to get Paradise, as proven in other narrations. Yazid added that they believed Jaber\u2019s words and did not think that he told lies. As a result, Yazid and his friends repented to Allah and came back after performing pilgrimage without calling to the doctrine of Kharijites except one man. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It proves the Prophet's intercession on the Day of Resurrection, (2) It proves the bridge over Hell in the hereafter, and (3) It proves that disobedient believers will enter Paradise after being initially punished in Hell.."}, {"number": 73, "hadith": "Anas ibn Malek narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u201cFour persons will be brought out from Hell and presented to Allah. One of them will turn and say, \u2018O my Lord, if you bring me out from it, do not throw me back into it.\u2019 Then Allah rescues him from it.\u201d.", "commentary": "If a Muslim hopes and has good thoughts about Allah, He will accept his deeds and respond to him, for He is Most Compassionate and Merciful to His servants. He created Paradise as an abode of eternal bliss for His pious servants and Hell as a punishment for His disobedient and disbelieved servants. Whoever witnesses Hereafter's terrors and wins Paradise exactly knows Allah's grace and favor upon him. In this hadith, the Prophet (\ufdfa) informed that there would be four men getting out of Hell on that day. It is said they will be the last ones getting out of it. They would be presented to Him to be reckoned. Allah's command would be that they would be punished in Hell for their sins although they believe in Allah. Afterward, one of them would turn to Allah - after being commanded to go to Hell as a test, as Ahmad's narration mentioned, and call Allah: O Allah, I was hoping if you got me out of it, you would not return me to it. As a result, Allah would save him from Hell and admit him to Paradise as in the narration of Ibn Hibban. Finally, this hadith contains the following lessons: (1) Allah's extraordinary generosity, (2) The virtue of having good thoughts about Allah, and (3) Urging the generous people to complete their grants, for those who bestow grants do not follow them with the opposite.."}, {"number": 74, "hadith": "Abu Huraira and Hudhaifa narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \"When Allah, the Almighty, gathers people, the believers will stand till Paradise is brought near them. They will come and say to Adam, 'O father, open Paradise for us.' He will say, 'Did you get out of Paradise but due to your father Adam\u2019s sin? It is not my position to do so. Go to my son Ibrahim, the Friend of Allah.' Ibrahim said, 'It is not my position to do so. I was a friend (of Allah) beyond a veil. Go to Moses with whom Allah conversed.' They will come to Moses who will say, 'It is not my position to do so. Go to Jesus, the word and spirit of Allah.' Jesus will say, 'It is not my position to do so.' They will go to Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa. He will stand and be permitted (to open Paradise's door). Trustworthiness and kinship will be dispatched to stand on the right and left of the Path (over Hell). The first of you will pass just like the lightning.\" Abu Huraira asked, \"You are dearer to me than my father and my mother! Which thing is like the passing of lightning?\" The Prophet resumed, \"Did you not see how the lightning passes back and forth in the twinkling of an eye? Then (they will pass) like the passing of the wind, like the passing of a bird, and like fast persons, each according to his deeds while your Prophet is standing at the Path saying, 'O God, save us, save us!' (The people will be passing) till the servants' deeds weaken to the extent that a man cannot walk (on that Path) but crawlingly. There are suspended hooks on the Path's sides which are commanded to catch whoever they are required to catch. Some will be scratched and saved while others piled up in Hell.\" Abu Hurairah said, \"By Him in Whose Hand is the life of Abu Huraira, Hell is seventy years deep.\".", "commentary": "Allah is Most Compassionate and Merciful to His servants, whose mercy encompasses all things. He made Paradise the abode of eternal bliss for His pious servants and Hell the punishment for His disobedient and disbelieved servants. Whoever witnesses Hereafter's terrors and wins Paradise exactly knows Allah's grace and favor upon him. In this hadith, the Prophet \ufdfa informed us about some events on the Day of Resurrection. On that day, Allah will bring his believing servants near Paradise to the extent that they will be deeply eager to enter it to avoid the terrors of that day. As a result, they will be searching for whoever intercedes for them with Alah to finalize recking people. Anas narrated, as in Sahih Muslim, that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \"So they will be concerned or inspired and say, 'If only we intercede with our God so that He relieves us from our current place.\" The meaning is either: (1) They will be concerned with interceding with Allah to end the distress they are suffering from, or (2) Allah will inspire them to intercede with him. They will ask some Prophets to intercede with Allah to enter them to Paradise. They will ask Prophet Adam, Father of humankind, but he will decline and remind them about his sin of eating the forbidden tree. He will confirm that it is not his position to do so. The position he mentions is the greatest position of intercession called the Praiseworthy Position. It is narrated in Bukhari and Muslim that Prophet Adam said, \"Verily, my God is angry to an extent to which He had never been angry before nor would He be angry afterward. Verily, He forbade me (eating from) the tree, but I disobeyed. Myself! (thrice) Go to someone else.\" He will guide them to go to Prophet Ibrahim. He was a close friend to Allah, one of the best Prophets, and a grandfather of Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa. When asking him to intercede with Allah, he will decline and confirm it is not his position to do so, out of modesty, for he was a close friend to Allah, but Allah spoke to him beyond a veil. He will remind them that he lied three times as narrated in the Two Sahihs that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \"The Prophet Ibrahim never lied but thrice. Two of them were for the sake of Allah when he said, 'Verily, I am sick,' 'Nay, this one, the biggest of them (idols) did it,' and the last one was for Sara (his wife).\" He will guide them to go to Prophet Moses with whom Allah spoke without an intermediary or a veil. Allah says, \"And to Moses, Allah spoke directly.\" (An-Nisa: 164) Speech is a proven attribute for Allah and is not similar to others' speech. In the Two Sahihs, they will come and say to Moses, \"O Musa! You are the Messenger of Allah whom He distinguished above the people with His Message and His Speech ... He answered, 'Indeed I killed a person whom I was not ordered to kill.'\" He will inform them that it is not his position to do so and guide them to go to the Prophet Jesus. In the Two Sahihs, they will say, \"O Jesus, you are the Messenger of Allah, His Word which He placed into Mariam, and a Spirit from Him. You spoke to people in the cradle ... He will not mention a sin.\u201d Abu Saeed narrated as in Sunan At-Termidhi that Jesus will say, \u201cI was worshiped besides Allah.\u201d He will inform them that it is not his position to do so. Jesus said, as Anas reported in the Two Sahihs, \"But go to Muhammad \ufdfa, a servant whose previous and future sins were forgiven.\u201d In Bukhari's narration, Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa said, \"So they will come to me and I will prostrate under the throne. It will be said, 'O Muhammad \ufdfa, raise your head, intercede and you will be granted intercession, and ask and you will be granted.\u2019\u201d He will intercede to remove people's distress and sorrow. He will be allowed to enter Paradise as it is apparent in the hadith or granted his promised position of intercession. Also, both trustworthiness and kinship will be dispatched to stand on the right and left of the bridge over Hell, for their high prestige. They will stand there waiting for the trustworthy, traitors, those fostering and breaking ties of kinship. They will support those keeping them and witness against those violating them. Afterward, people will begin to pass the bridge over Hell. The first will rapidly pass just like the lightning without being scratched by fire flames, some will pass like the wind, some will pass like a bird, and some will pass as fast persons, each according to his deeds, out of Allah's mercy and justice. The Prophet \ufdfa will be standing at the bridge supplicating Allah, \"O God, save us, save us,\" out of his compassion and mercy for people. Once their deeds weaken, some people will pass crawlingly while others may be caught and thrown to Hell or scratched by suspended hooks on the bridge's sides as Allah commands. Abu Huraira swore that Hell is seventy years deep. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It proves the Prophet's intercession, (2) It clarifies the virtue of trustworthiness and kinship, (3) It confirms the reality of the bridge over Hell, (4) It shows the different types of people passing over the bridge, (5) It explains the virtue of Prophet Moses for his speaking to Allah, and (6) One should supplicate Allah according to the situation he experiences.."}, {"number": 75, "hadith": "Anas ibn Malek narrated, \u201cThe Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u2018I will have the most followers in comparison with other prophets on the Day of Resurrection and the first to knock at the door of Paradise.\u201d.", "commentary": "The Prophet's merits are great and supreme. He was sent to all people including Jews and Christians. All people must believe and follow him. This hadith shows some of his virtues on the Day of Resurrection. He will have the most followers on that day in comparison with other prophets. It means that having more followers means having a supreme prophet so Allah dignifies this Muslim nation for dignifying his Prophet. No nation will be like his nation, for it will form half of Paradise's people as in the two Sahihs. Moreover, he will be the first to knock at Paradise's door then its guard will open it for him.

This hadith mentions some of his merits such as he will be the first to enter Paradise after Allah accepts his intercession to open it, as in Imam Muslim's narration. Later his intercession will be accepted for two types of people: (1) The disobedient to be admitted to Paradise, and (2) Those who entered Paradise but got lower ranks. Imam Ahmad narrated that the Prophet said, \u201cI will be the first to enter Paradise on the Day of Resurrection and I am not boasting. When I come to the gate of Paradise and take its ring, they will ask, 'Who is this?' I will answer, 'Muhammad.' They will open it for me. I will enter and see the Mighty facing me. I will prostrate to Him and He will say, 'O Muhammad, raise your head, speak so you will be responded, say so your requests will be accepted, and intercede so your intercession will be granted.' I will raise my head and say, 'O God, my nation, my nation.' He will say, 'Go to your nation. Whoever you find in his heart a weight of barley grain of faith, admit him to Paradise.' So I will accept. Whoever I find that in his heart, I will admit him to Paradise.\u201d In addition, he will have the most followers on that day in comparison with other prophets. It indicates that having more followers means having a supreme followed one. Allah dignifies this nation for dignifying his Prophet. No nation will be like his nation on the Day of Resurrection, for it will form half of Paradise's people as in the two Sahihs' narration or even two-thirds as Imam Ahmad, Tirmedhy, and Ibn Maja reported. Moreover, he confirmed that there was a prophet who was only believed by one man from his nation.

In this hadith, he recited Prophet Ibrahim's supplication to his nation in the Quran, \"O\u2009my Lord! They have indeed led astray many among mankind. But whoso follows me, he, verily, is of me.\" (Ibrahim: 36) Prophet Ibrahim means that whoever follows me and abandons worshipping idols, he is one of my followers who deserves forgiveness and mercy. Whoever disobeys and continues worshipping idols, it is up to Allah. If He Wills, He guides him and if He Wills, He goes him astray. Allah does not forgive those dying while being polytheists as He said, \"Verily, Allah does not forgive that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives, except that, anything else to whom He wills; and whoever sets up partners with Allah (in worship), he has indeed invented a\u2009tremendous sin.\" (An-Nisa\u2019: 48) Then, he recited Prophet Jesus' saying in the Quran, \"If You punish them, they are Your slaves, and if You forgive them, verily You, only You, are the All\u2011Mighty, the All\u2011Wise.\" (Al-Ma'idah: 118) Afterward, the Prophet (\ufdfa) wept and supplicated Him, \"O Allah, my nation, my nation!\" Due to his deep love for his nation, he asked Allah's mercy, kindness, and goodness to them. Although Allah knows all that the breasts conceal, he sent Gabriel to ask the Prophet (\ufdfa) about the reason for his weeping. It was said that this was to show the Prophet's prestige and honor. Gabriel asked the Prophet (\ufdfa) who informed him about what he asked Allah. Thus, Allah asked Gabriel to inform the Prophet (\ufdfa) that He would please and grant him what he asked and not displease him with regard to his nation, as Allah said, \"And verily, your Lord will give you (all good) so that you shall be well\u2011pleased.\" (Ad-Duha: 5) This is one of the best glad tidings to Muslim nation. On the other hand, this hadith explains the Quranic verse, \"Verily, there has come to you a\u2009Messenger from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He is anxious over you; for the believers full of pity, kind, and merciful.\" (At-Tawbah: 128).

When he noticed the man\u2019s sadness, he wanted to console him to find contentment, for if there had been a son who wanted to benefit his disbelieved father, the Prophet would have been the first one to do so. It was the revelation that informed the Prophet of his own father's destiny. This is because whoever died before the Prophet's message of Islam and followed the Arabs\u2019 practice of worshiping idols was one of the people of Hell. As a matter of fact, the people of that period received the call of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) and other prophets.

Allah said, \"... will have cut out for them garments of fire.\" (Al-Hajj: 19) Although he is the least tormented one in Hell, his brain will boil due to just the heat of his shoes. Some said that all of his body is tormented while others said it is just his feet, out of kindness. It was said that it is the Prophet's uncle Abu Taleb, for the Prophet's saying, when his uncle was mentioned, as in the two Sahihs, \u201cMy intercession may benefit him on the Day of Resurrection so that he may be placed in a shallow part of fire reaching only up to his ankles and causing his brain to boil.\u201d The hadith included him and other ones who would be punished likewise. The hadith refers that the people of Hell are those abiding in it forever such as the disbelievers.

He was a Qureish leader from the tribe of Banu Tamim ibn Murrah during the pre-Islamic ignorant times before the Prophet's mission. It was called so, for it was full of ignorant practices. At that time, Ibn Jud'an used to establish ties of relationship, feed the poor, and follow lots of manners that Islam would encourage later. She was wondering if these righteous acts would benefit him in the hereafter and save him from Allah's punishment of the polytheists due to his disbelief. The Prophet (\ufdfa) told her that all of his works would not benefit him, for he never believed in neither Allah nor the Last Day. A disbeliever will not get a reward in the hereafter for his righteous acts, for he nullified them by his disbelief. This is an indication that if he had embraced Islam, these acts would have benefitted him. As for his acts\u2019 reward in this worldly life, Imam Muslim reported that Anas ibn Malek narrated that the Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \u201cAllah does not unjustly prevent a believer from even a good deed\u2019s reward. He is rewarded in this world and in the Hereafter. As for the disbeliever, he is given a reward for the good deeds he did for the sake of Allah in the world and when he comes to Hereafter, there is no rewards for him.\u201d Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It clarifies the virtue of faith, the prerequisite for accepting righteous deeds, (2) It shows the terrible results of disbelief which nullifies the reward of the righteous deeds.."}, {"number": 83, "hadith": "Abu Malek Al-Hareth ibn \u2018Asem Al-Ash'ary narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \"Purity is half of faith, al-hamdulillah fills the scale, and subhanallah and al-hamdulillah fill what is between the heavens and Earth. Prayer is a light, charity is proof, and patience is illumination. The Quran is proof for or against you. All people go out early in the morning and sell themselves, either setting themselves free or ruining themselves.\".", "commentary": "This is a great hadith and one of the Islamic foundations in which the Prophet (\ufdfa) mentioned all that concerns a Muslim in his life and the afterlife. The Prophet (\ufdfa) confirmed that purification is half of faith. It means one of the two following meanings: (1) All Islamic aspects aim to purify a Muslim inwardly from evil attributes and outwardly from impurities as in purification, or (2) The word faith means prayer as in Allah's saying, \"And Allah would never make your faith be lost.\" (Al-Baqarah: 143) So, the hadith means that purification is half of prayer which is not accepted without it. Moreover, the Prophet (\ufdfa) added that the saying of al-hamdulillah (all praise is due to Allah) will fill one's scale on the Day of Resurrection with reward when Allah weighs all people's deeds. It is a real scale to weigh their deeds, which does not resemble the worldly scales. It is one of the matters of the unseen world that we all must believe in. Al-hamdulillah means to acknowledge that Allah, alone, deserves all types of gratitude. The Prophet (\ufdfa) added that subhanallah (glory be to Allah) meant to describe Allah with the complete perfection he deserves and negate all that contradict this perfection. These two sentences fill what is between heaven and Earth, for they contain praising Allah, negating all that contradicts His perfection, and showing the servant's need for his Creator. Moreover, the Prophet (\ufdfa) added that prayer is a light. This means one of the following possibilities: (1) It is a light on a Muslim's face in this life and in his way in the afterlife, unlike those who do not pray, (2) It guides a servant to the straight path and makes him away from sins, immorality, and indecency, or (3) It means all the above-mentioned possibilities, for it is a light in his heart, face, grave, and hereafter. Moreover, the Prophet (\ufdfa) added that charity is proof of a Muslim's truthful faith, unlike a hypocrite who does not give charity, for he does not believe. Then, the Prophet (\ufdfa) added that patience is a shining light. It is a light with heat and burning power like the sun, unlike the moon. He mentioned this similarity, for patience was a difficult attribute that required struggling oneself in preventing prohibited desires and whims. The recommended patience is during three cases: (1) Patience in obeying Allah, (2) Patience in avoiding disobeying Him, and (3) Patience during calamities and hardships. Thus, patience will be a light for us throughout the straight way. Then, the Prophet (\ufdfa) showed one's stand with the Quran in the hereafter. He confirmed that it would be proof for a person if he kept reciting and acting upon it in this life. On the other hand, it would be proof against him when he left reciting or acting upon it. The Prophet (\ufdfa) mentioned that all people went out early in the morning and sold themselves, either setting themselves free from Hell by obeying Allah or ruining themselves in Hell by obeying their whims and the devil. Thus, hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It shows the virtue of purification and its reward, (2) It mentions some sayings and deeds of faith that set the believers free from Hell, (3) It clarifies that a person will be held accountable for his actions, so he is free to choose the way he wants to himself.."}, {"number": 84, "hadith": "Mus'ab ibn Sa'd narrated, \"Abdullah ibn Omar visited Ibn 'Amer when he was sick. Ibn 'Amer said to him, 'O Ibn Omar, will you not supplicate Allah to me?' Ibn Omar replied, 'I heard the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, 'No prayer is accepted without ablution and no charity is accepted due to ghulul (taking spoils before authorized distribution). You were the governor of Al-Basrah.'\".", "commentary": "The Prophet's companions used to advise people on religious and worldly matters in accordance with people\u2019s cases and abilities. The caliph Uthman ibn Affan appointed Abdullah ibn Amer ibn Kuraiz a ruler over Basra after Abu Musa Al-Ash\u2019ary in 29 H. Later, Uthamn appointed him over Basra and Fares after Othman ibn Abi Al-'As. Later, the caliph Mu'aweya ibn Abi Sufyan appointed him a ruler over Basra and then dismissed him after three years. Afterward, Abdullah lived in Medina until he died in 57 or 58 H. In this hadith, Abdullah ibn Omar visited Ibn 'Amer when he was sick. Ibn 'Amer asked him to supplicate Allah to him, for the Prophet's companion Abdullah ibn Omar was one of the righteous persons at that time. So, Ibn 'Amer was keen to ask for his supplication during this hardship. Abu Nu'aim narrated in his Mustakhraj, \"When Abdullah ibn Omar visited Ibn 'Amer during his illness, people were praising Ibn 'Amer but Ibn Omar kept silent. Ibn Amer said to him, \u2018O Abu Abdderrhman, what does prevent you from saying (alike)?\u2019 Ibn Omar wisely answered, \u2018I heard the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) say, 'No prayer is accepted without ablution and no charity is accepted due to ghulul (taking spoils before authorized distribution).\u2019\u201d Ablution is a prerequisite to make prayer accepted and charity is not accepted if it is taken from spoils before authorized distribution. Generally, this hadith includes taking illegal money. Ibn Omar meant that Allah did not accept charity from illegal sources and Ibn 'Amer used to illegally take people's properties during his rule over some cities. Ibn Omar wanted to scold him for his old sins and urge him to repent to Allah although Ibn \u2018Amer was dismissed in 29 H. and died in 57 or 58 H. Ibn Omar wanted to urge other rulers to perform righteous deeds and fear Allah. He also wanted to warn them against oppression and negligence. Ibn Omar scolded him although the Prophet (\ufdfa), his companions, and the righteous ones after them used to supplicate Allah for people of sins. In the Two Sahihs, Abu Hurairah narrated, \"Tufail ibn Amr Ad-Daousy and his companions came to the Prophet (\ufdfa) and said, 'O Messenger of Allah, the tribe of Daous disobeyed and refused so supplicate Allah against them.' Someone said, 'Daous will be destroyed.' The Prophet (\ufdfa) said, 'O Allah, guide the tribe of Daous and let them come.\u2019\u201d Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It urges Muslims to visit the patient, (2) It confirms the scholars' advice to rulers with wisdom and good words, (3) It contains the virtue of ablution, (4) It contains the virtue of giving charity from legal properties, (5) It shows the legitimacy of asking righteous people for supplication to Allah, (6) It clarifies Ibn Omar's deep keenness in enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, without flattery, and (7) It indicates that having illegal properties prevents accepting one's supplication.."}, {"number": 85, "hadith": "Humran, the servant of Uthman, narrated, \"I heard Uthman - when he was in the courtyard of the mosque and asked for water to perform ablution after the caller to prayer came to him - said, 'By Allah, I am narrating to you a hadith.

If there had not been a verse in the Book of Allah, I would have never narrated it to you.\u2019\u201d The verse he meant was Allah\u2019s saying, \"Verily, those who conceal the clear proofs and the guidance, which We have sent down, after We have made it clear for the people in the Book, they are the ones cursed by Allah and cursed by the cursers.\" (Al-Baqarah: 159) It means that Allah will expel them from His mercy and people ask Him to expel them from His mercy as well. It was only this verse that encouraged Uthman to narrate this Prophetic hadith although he preferred not to narrate it temporarily, for he was afraid that people may have been deceived by their little obedience to Allah. In the end, he decided to narrate it and confirmed that he heard the Prophet saying, \u201cIf a Muslim properly performs ablution and offers prayer, Allah will forgive him the sins committed to the next prayer.\" The prayer mentioned here is the obligatory one and the sins mentioned here are the minor, for repentance is a prerequisite to forgive the major sins. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) Caliph Uthman was keen to teach people goodness, (2) It warns against concealing Islamic knowledge, (3) It urges people to learn and properly abide by ablution's etiquette and conditions, (4) It stressed on the virtue of properly performing ablution, and (5) The legitimacy of swearing without being asked to swear.."}, {"number": 86, "hadith": "Amr ibn Saeed ibn Al-'As said, \"I was with Uthman who asked for ablution water and said, 'I heard the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa saying, 'When the time for a prescribed prayer is due and a Muslim properly performs its ablution, submissiveness, and bowing, it will be an expiation for his past sins as long as he did not commit a major sin.

This applies for all times.\" Submissiveness in prayer means that all Muslim's limbs are facing Allah and recalling His greatness. Also, the above-mentioned sins are the minor ones, for forgiving the major sins necessitate repentance. The major sins are those sins that are called in the Quran, the authentic Sunnah, or consensus major sins, necessitate severe punishment, or its doer was cursed or highly reprehensible. This favor from Allah is general and applied to all times, not confined to a specific time. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It clarifies the virtue of frequently persevering the acts of worship, which is a reason for forgiving minor sins, and (2) It confirms the virtue of ablution and submissiveness in prayer.."}, {"number": 87, "hadith": "Humran ibn Aban narrated, \u201cI used to fetch water of ablution for Uthman.

Thus, the Prophet \ufdfa used to encourage people to perform them, by mentioning its reward. In this hadith, Humran ibn Aban, the servant of Othman ibn Affan, narrated that he used to fetch water of ablution for Othman. There was not a day that Othman did not take a bath with a small quantity of water. He was keen to purify himself, out of cleanliness and seeking great rewards mentioned in this hadith. Then, Othman narrated that one day the Prophet \ufdfa finished the afternoon prayer and gave his companions the choice between speaking to them or keeping silent to draw their attention for knowledge. They replied, \u201cIf it is good, tell us about it, and if it is otherwise, Allah and His Prophet \ufdfa know best.\u201d Their response indicates their high good manners with the Prophet \ufdfa.

In another narration in Sahih Muslim, he said, \u201cUnless the major sins are committed.\u201d Thus, the above-mentioned forgiveness is applied to the minor, not the major sins which Allah may forgive or punish its doer.

As a result, mere walking to perform prayer in a mosque is a reason for forgiving one\u2019s sins and raising his ranks in Paradise. Similarly, Allah makes ablution and prayer reasons for purifying people from the effects of their sins. Also, he promises that performing acts of worship based on their conditions is a reason for forgiveness. In this hadith, the Prophet (\ufdfa) said that whoever properly and perfectly performs ablution then walks to perform an obligatory prayer with people, with the congregation, or in the mosque, Allah will forgive his sins. The repeated \"or\" may be due to a narrator's doubt so the hadith means that a Muslim performs an obligatory prayer with people in a mosque and if they finished it, he would perform it alone in the mosque. Also, it may mean that a Muslim performs an obligatory prayer with people whether in a mosque or somewhere else, so the hadith focusses on performing it with people. As a result, Allah will forgive all of his sins. On the other hand, it was proven in the Quranic and Prophetic texts that it is the minor, not the major sins that will be forgiven, for forgiving major sins necessitates repentance, decisive intention not to commit them again along with some other prerequisites.

Repentance is a prerequisite to expiate them. The major sin is the sin that the Quran, the Sunnah, or the scholars' consensus: (1) Stipulated as a major sin, (2) Mentioned a severe punishment or a specific penalty of its doer, and (3) Deeply dispraised or cursed its doer.

After finishing his tiring task, Uqbah went to the Prophetic Mosque and found the Prophet (\ufdfa) standing and addressing people, \"If any Muslim performs ablution properly, then performs two rak'ahs with his face and heart (outwardly and inwardly), Paradise will be guaranteed for him.\" His words, \"... with his face and heart ...\" meant to be sincere and submissive and avoid turning face or making heart busy with thoughts other than prayer details. As a result, the reward is Paradise. Uqbah was astonished by this simple act of worship with the glad tiding and supreme reward. Uqbah lately came to the speech, so he did not hear the speech from the beginning. Omar commented on Uqbah\u2019s opinion, \"The words before them were better.\" Omar told him what he (Uqbah) missed of the Prophetic words, \"If anyone amongst you performs ablution properly, then says, 'I testify that there is no god worthy of worship but Allah and that Muhammad is the servant and messenger of Allah, the eight gates of Paradise will be opened for him, so he can enter by whichever of them he wishes.\" Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It clarifies Allah\u2019s great reward.

In this hadith, Abu Hazim Al-Ashja\u2019i narrated that he was standing behind Abu Hurairah during his performing ablution for prayer. Abu Hurairah washed his hands and arms until he reached his armpits, hoping to wash the longest part of his arms. Abu Hazim asked him about the reason for this ablution that he had never seen anyone perform. Abu Hurairah was surprised that Abu Hazem was there and confirmed that if he had known he was seeing him, he would not have performed it this way. As for his saying \"Sons of Faroukh,\" it meant the non-Arab. Abu Hurairah meant that a leader should take much care about his public acts, so he has to refrain from doing some acts of allowable lenience or strictness if he thinks that people may imitate him. They may follow his lenience without necessity or his strictness thinking it is an obligation. Then, Abu Hurairah clarified the reason for his way of ablution. He heard the Prophet confirm that the believer's whiteness, in Paradise, would reach the places where the ablution reached. As a result, Abu Hurairah wanted his ablution to reach the longest part of his arms. This hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It shows the believers' honor, as they will be singled out for the whiteness of faces and feet, (2) A scholar has to avoid doing some acts before the public if he fears that they do not realize what he does, (3) It shows the virtue of exaggeratedly washing the forehead and feet through washing beyond the obligatory place.."}, {"number": 98, "hadith": "Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u201cWill I tell you about something for which Allah obliterates sins and elevates ranks?\u201d They said, \u201cOf course O Allah's Messenger!\u201d He said, \u201cProperly performing ablution in spite of difficulties, taking many steps to mosques, and waiting for the next prayer after observing the current one. That is the defense of the frontier.\u201d.", "commentary": "Prayer is of great prestige in Islam, for it is one of its pillars and bases. The Prophet (\ufdfa) clarified that Allah boasted about His worshiping servants and those waiting for prayer's appointed times before His angels. In this sense, the Prophet (\ufdfa) told his companions about three reasons for which Allah obliterated sins and elevated ranks. First: Properly washing each member during ablution despite difficulties like coldness or pain. Second: Frequently going to mosques to attend congregational prayers. Third: Waiting for the next obligatory prayer after performing the current obligatory one. Then, he explained that those sticking to these three acts were just like those defending the frontier, which was one of the greatest acts of worship in the sight of Allah. This Prophetic similarity confirmed that these acts were means to fight and block devilish whispers and one's prohibited whims. In another narration, the Prophet (\ufdfa) repeated it thrice, \"That is the defense of the frontier,\u201d to confirm their great reward.."}, {"number": 99, "hadith": "Shuraih said, \"I asked Aisha, 'What was the first thing the Prophet \ufdfa used to do when entering home?'\" She replied, \"He used to use siwak (tooth-stick.\".", "commentary": "The siwak is a means to get Allah's pleasing and purify our mouths, as the trustworthy Prophet (\ufdfa) confirmed.

She told him that the first thing was to use siwak to cleanse and purify his mouth. This was a part of his manners and caring about his wife. As a result, he was a role model that we should follow.

In this hadith, the great companion Abdullah ibn Abbas mentioned that he spent a night in his aunt Maimouna\u2019s house, a wife of the Prophet \ufdfa. He found that the Prophet \ufdfa got up in the last part of the night, went out, looked at the sky, and recited Allah\u2019s sayings, \u201cVerily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding. Those who remember Allah standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides, and think deeply about the creation of the heavens and the earth, (saying), \u2018Our Lord! You have not created (all) this without purpose, glory to You!

They are those remembering Allah in all of their cases whether they are standing, sitting, or lying down. They are always pondering over the creation of heavens and earth then supplicate Allah, \u201cOur Lord! You have not created (all) this without purpose, glory to You! Give us salvation from the torment of the Fire.\u201d Then, the Prophet \ufdfa went home and used the siwak, which was a stick made of the roots of the arak tree, to clean his mouth and always smell good. Afterward, he performed ablution and night prayer then slept for a while. Later, he got up and exactly repeated what he did the first time.

In this hadith, Anas ibn Malik narrated that the Prophet (as in Abu Dawud's and Al-Nasa\u2019i's narration) talked about four issues that a Muslim was not allowed to leave for more than forty days. (1) Trimming the mustache: A Muslim should trim the hair growing on the upper lip. In the Two Sahihs, Ibn Omar narrated that the Prophet said, \"Do the opposite of what the polytheists do. Let the beard grow long and clip the mustache.\" (2) Trimming the nails: This is because they contain dirties that prevent water during purification and ablution. (3) Plucking armpit hair: This is because its smell stinks due to sweat if it is uncut for a long time. Plucking is better if one bears it but removing it by any means is allowable. (4) Shaving the pubic hair: It is the hair growing around one's private parts. Finally, a Muslim is not allowed to leave them for more than forty days. However, it is better to cut them before.

Thus, a Muslim combines internal and external cleanliness and purity.."}, {"number": 103, "hadith": "Aisha said, \"The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said, 'There are ten matters of pure nature: (1) Trimming the mustache, letting the beard grow, Siwak (tooth-stick), rinsing the nose (in ablution), clipping the nails, washing the knuckles, plucking the armpit hairs, shaving the pubic hairs, and washing one's private parts (after relieving oneself).\" Zakareyya said that Mus'ab (hadith narrator) said, \"I forgot the tenth which may have been rinsing the mouth.\".", "commentary": "Islamic law collects the best of everything, so its rules are in harmony with pure human nature, including rules caring about internal and external human cleanliness. In this hadith, the Prophet (\ufdfa) mentioned ten matters of pure original nature with which all people were given birth. They are: (1) Trimming the mustache: A Muslim should trim the hair growing on the upper lip, as Ibn Omar narrated in the Two Sahihs that the Prophet said, \"Do the opposite of what the polytheists do. Let the beard grow long and clip the mustache,\" (2) Letting the beard grow: It is to let the hair of chin and cheeks grow without trimming it, (3) Using siwak (tooth-stick): It is a stick cut from arak tree which is used to clean and freshen the mouth and teeth, and remove unpleasant odors, (4) Rinsing the nose: It is to sniff water into the nose then blow it out to remove any dirt or filth, (5) Trimming fingers\u2019 and toes\u2019 nails: It is to trim them before exceeding forty days, for they contain dirties that may harm a person, as Anas narrated in Sahih Muslim, (6) Washing the knuckles: It is to wash any dirties that they may collect, (7) Plucking the armpit hairs: Plucking is better if one bears it but if a person removes it by any means, he follows the Prophetic tradition as well, (8) Shaving the pubic hair: It is to remove the hair growing around male\u2019s or female\u2019s private parts, (9) Washing one's private parts after relieving himself, and (10) Rinsing the mouth: It is to cleanse one\u2019s mouth then spit out the water, especially after eating or eating something with unpleasant smell. Moreover, Abu Hurairah narrated in the Two Sahihs that the Prophet (\ufdfa) mentioned circumcision as a matter of pure human nature. It is to cut the foreskin from a baby's penis or the top of the piece of skin that looks like a rooster\u2019s comb from a female baby\u2019s gentile. Finally, there is no doubt that these matters are related to religious and worldly benefits, such as improving one\u2019s appearance, cleansing the body generally and in detail, having keenness on purification, kindly keeping people away from any unpleasant smells that may harm them, and avoiding the practices of the disbelievers like Magus, Jews, and Christians.."}, {"number": 104, "hadith": "Salman, the Persian, said, \"The polytheists said to us, 'We see that your friend taught you how to go to the toilet.'

He also said, 'None of you should clean with less than three pebbles.'\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (\ufdfa) was keen to teach his nation all aspects of Islam and correct the mistakes and habits they followed during the period before Islam. Thus, he taught them the etiquette of relieving oneself. The polytheists used to mock his companions and wondered, as Salman narrated, that the Prophet (\ufdfa) taught his companions all Islamic matters even if how they should purify themselves after answering the call of nature. As a result, Salman proudly answered them, \"Yes\" and added that the Prophet (\ufdfa) taught them to avoid the right hand in purifying oneself from urine or feces, due to respecting and dedicating it to honorable and noble things while dedicating the left one to remove filths and impurities. Purification is to use water or something similar to remove what comes out from one's penis, vagina, or anus. Salman added that the Prophet (\ufdfa) prohibited them from facing the prayer direction while answering the call of nature. This is applied to doing so in deserts not in houses or similar close places. Abu Daoud reported that Marwan ibn Al-Asfar narrated, \"I saw Ibn Omar when he making his camel kneel and facing the prayer direction. He sat down to urinate, so I asked him, \"O Abu Abdurrahman, was it not forbidden?\" He replied, \"It is only forbidden if you do it in deserts, but there is no problem if there is something between you and the prayer direction.\" Salman added that the Prophet (\ufdfa) and  prohibited them from using dung or bones in purification. The former material is impure and the latter is the food of jinn. In Sahih Muslim, the Prophet (\ufdfa) answered the Jinn when they asked him for food, \"Every bone on which the name of Allah is recited is your provision. When it falls in your hand, it will be completely covered with flesh, and every dung is fodder for your animals.\" Salman added that the Prophet (\ufdfa) prohibited them from purifying themselves (after answering the call of nature) with less than three pure and dry pebbles. A Muslim can use more than three pebbles until he makes sure he is completely purified. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It clarifies the Prophet's keenness to guide his nation to all useful points, even the most minute details, (2) It contains some of the etiquette that a Muslim has to follow while relieving himself, and (3) A Muslim has to be proud of Islamic teachings, especially in front of those mocking and ridiculing him.."}, {"number": 105, "hadith": "Jaber ibn Abdullah narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa forbade the use of bone or camels' droppings for wiping (after excretion).\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (\ufdfa) taught his companions all the Islamic manners to the extent that he taught them the manners of entering the toilet.

In this hadith, he forbade us to turn our faces or backs toward the prayer direction. This is out of glorifying and preserving the Kaaba, the Sacred House of Allah in Mecca. Instead, a Muslim has to avoid these two directions.

In this hadith, he warned against: (1) Two things that necessitate cursing their doers, or (2) Two things that people curse. Cursing is expulsion from Allah's mercy. When the Prophet's companions asked him about these two acts, he replied, \"Answering the call of nature in the people's way or under their shades.\" He forbade these acts, for they spread filths and impurities of nasty smell in people's way and under their shadows. This hadith contains the following benefits: (1) Islamic law\u2019s keenness to keep individuals and societies away from what hurt them, which may lead to curse and insult each other, and (2) It urges Muslims to stick to reasons for bringing love, happiness, and hope goodness for each other and removing harms and difficulties.."}, {"number": 108, "hadith": "Anas ibn Malek narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa entered a garden while a little servant was following him with a jar of water and he was the youngest amongst us.

The boy was carrying a jar of enough water for ablution and placed it next to a lote-tree for the Prophet (\ufdfa). After answering the call of nature, the Prophet (\ufdfa) used this water to purify himself from traces of urine and feces then came out of the garden.

The Prophet (\ufdfa) may have done it for one of the following reasons: (1) He did not find something to sit on, (2) He had something that prevented him from sitting such as a wound, or (3) To protect his private parts in this garbage. Huthaifa went aside until the Prophet (\ufdfa) finished relieving himself. Afterward, the Prophet (\ufdfa) asked him to come closer to take water for ablution.

After relieving himself, the Prophet \ufdfa asked Al-Mughirah for water to perform ablution. Al-Mughirah provided him with a leather jar of water. The Prophet \ufdfa washed his palms and face. His gown\u2019s sleeve was too tight to wash his arms to elbows. Therefore, he brought them out from under the gown and threw it over his shoulders to wash his arms and keep his gown dry. Although the basic principle is to wipe the entire head once during ablution, the Prophet \ufdfa wiped his forelock and turban. He wiped the visible front part of his head and wiped his turban instead of the entire head. Then, he did not wash his feet but wiped over his socks. To wipe over one\u2019s socks, it is a prerequisite to wear them after an initial ablution, as Al-Mughirah narrated in the Two Sahihs, \u201cWhen I was with the Prophet \ufdfa on a journey, I dashed to take off his socks (so he could wash his feet) but he said, \u2018Leave them, for I wore them after performing ablution.\u2019 So he wiped over them.\u201d Then, the Prophet \ufdfa and Al-Mughirah rode their animals.

Once Abdurrahman completed the prayer, both the Prophet \ufdfa and Al-Mughirah got up to offer the rak'a they missed. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It is legitimate that the virtuous one can be led in prayer by a person of lower rank, (2) A Muslim should be keen to perform prayer at their specific times, (3) It clarifies the virtue of Abderrahman ibn Awf, and (4) It is legitimate to wipe over the turban and socks.."}, {"number": 111, "hadith": "Bilal narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa wiped over his leather socks and head cover.

It was his habit to perform ablution for each prayer, as in Sunan Abu Dawud. As a result, Omar asked him, \"You have done something today that you have not been accustomed to.\" The Prophet (\ufdfa) confirmed that he did that on purpose to teach people that it is permissible to offer all daily prayers with one ablution, out of easiness, for ablution is not required if it is still valid. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) The Prophet's Companions used to observe him to follow his actions and teachings, (2) The permissibility of a student's asking his teacher about his deeds that may contradict his habits, out of learning, (3) The permissibility of wiping over the socks.."}, {"number": 114, "hadith": "Abu Hurairah narrated, \"The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, 'The purification of a utensil of any one of you, after licked by a dog, is to wash it seven times, using earth for the first time.'\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (\ufdfa) forbade the unnecessary purchasing of a dog because it contained impurity and the angel never entered houses containing dogs or statues. The Prophet (\ufdfa) guided us on how to purify a utensil if a dog would lick it with saliva, tongue, or mouth. In this hadith, he guided us to wash the utensil seven isolated times, using earth for the first time.

Also, he guided people on how to wash utensils that dogs licked. They should be washed seven times with water and rubbed with earth the eighth time. It proves that both dogs' saliva and leftovers are impure. In Sahih Muslim, Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet (\ufdfa) ordered to wash that type of vessels with water seven times, and the first washing should be with the earth. Washing it seven times is out of devotion or due to the impure saliva. In Nasa'i's narration, the Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \u201cOne of them is with the earth,\" So, it is not a prerequisite to make the first washing with the earth. Using the earth is due to its ability to kill diseases of dogs' saliva stuck to vessels, which water only is not able to remove. Repeated washing with water is to make sure that a vessel becomes pure. There is no difference between types of dogs in this regard, whether or not, it is permissible to own it.

In the Two Sahihs, Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \"None of you is allowable to urinate in stagnant water, which is not flowing, then wash in it.\" A Muslim is commanded to preserve all types of water, flowing or stagnant, especially the latter, for it is unrenewable and subject to be corrupted if a person throws impurities into it such as urine and the like.."}, {"number": 117, "hadith": "Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \"None of you could wash in stagnant water if he engaged in intercourse.\" Abu Huraira was asked, \"O Abu Hurairah, how does one do it?\" Abu Hurairah answered, \"It was to be taken out in handfuls.\".", "commentary": "Islam urges us to preserve water sources to keep them pure and away from all types of pollution that may change any of its descriptions. In this hadith, Abu As-Sa'eb, the servant of Hesham ibn Zuhra, narrated that Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet (\ufdfa) forbade washing oneself due to intercourse or ejaculation in unrenewable stagnant water, for this act will lead to pollute and make the water dirty when people use it. It also makes it unsuitable for bathing as long as its characteristics (color, taste, or smell) change. The word \"janabah\" is applied to anyone who ejaculates or has intercourse. It is called that because a Muslim \"yatajannab\" (avoids) prayer and some acts of worship until he purifies himself. Abu As-Sa'eb asked Abu Hurairah about how to use the stagnant water for performing ablution. Abu Hurairah told him to scoop from it and perform ablution outside. This is for keeping the water pure and suitable for usage. A Muslim is commanded to preserve all types of water, flowing or stagnant, especially the latter, for it is unrenewable and subject to be corrupted if a person throws impurities into it.."}, {"number": 118, "hadith": "Abdullah ibn Shehab Al-Khawlany narrated, \"I stayed in the house of 'A'isha and had a wet dream, so I dipped and left both of my clothes in water. A maid-servant of A'isha saw me and informed her. 'A'isha called and asked me, 'Why did you do that with your clothes?' I answered, 'I saw in a dream what a sleeper saw.' She said, 'Did you find anything on your clothes?' I said, 'No.' She said, 'If you have found anything, you should have washed it. I remember when I scraped it (semen) off the garment of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) with my nails when it was dry.'\".", "commentary": "Islam is keen on purifying and cleaning Muslim\u2019s body and clothes and removing any hardships that may unintentionally happen. In this hadith, Abdullah ibn Shehab Al-Khawlany mentioned that he visited Aisha, the Mother of the Believers, and stayed at place that she prepared for her students of knowledge and guests out of honor, with a veil and curtain between her and them. Abdullah said that he once slept, had a wet dream, and thought it stuck to his clothes. The wet dream is to dream of having intercourse with the other gender, which is often accompanied by ejaculation. When Abdullah woke up, he dipped his clothes in water to purify them. A maid-servant of Aisha saw him and then informed her about what he did. The narration of At-Tirmidhy mentions, \u201cShe ordered (someone) to give him a yellow blanket to sleep in. He had a wet dream and was too shy to send it back to her while having traces of semen. He dipped it in water and sent it to her.\" This is evidence that he was in a place other than the one in which she stayed. She asked him about the reason for his dipping his clothes in the water. He answered her about the reason. Aisha asked him if he saw anything (traces of semen) on his clothes. He answered that he did not, which indicated that he may not have ejaculated on them. She clarified that they should be washed if they had traces of semen. Then, she told him that she used to scrape it (semen) off the garment of the Prophet (\ufdfa) with her nails when it (semen) was dry, which was an approval from the Prophet (\ufdfa). Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) Aisha was keen on teaching her students, especially when she saw something urgent such as this incident, (2) It is a part of etiquette to refrain from using explicit words to preserve the modesty of whom we are addressing, (3) It clarifies the Prophet\u2019s simple style in clothing, and (4) It illustrates how a woman serves her husband like washing his clothes and the like.."}, {"number": 119, "hadith": "Maimouna, the Prophet's wife, said, \u201cThe Prophet \ufdfa used to lie with me when I was menstruated, and there was a cloth between me and him.\".", "commentary": "Allah said, \"And they ask you about menstruation. Say, 'It is an annoyance. So keep away from women during menstruation, and do not approach them until they are purified.'\" (Al-Baqarah: 222) Thus, Allah forbade sexual intercourse during menstruation, but it is permissible to do anything other than penetration during this period as Maimouna, Mother of the Believers, narrated in this hadith that the Prophet (\ufdfa) used to lie down with her (a metaphor for intercourse) while she was menstruating but there was a garment in between. This is explained by Abu Daoud's narration that one of the Prophet's wives said, \"When the Prophet wanted to do something (i.e. kissing, embracing) with (his) menstruating wife, he would put a garment on her private part.\u201d."}, {"number": 120, "hadith": "Abu Hurairah narrated, \"While the Prophet \ufdfa was in his mosque, he asked Aisha, 'Get me the garment.' She replied, 'I was menstruating.' He remarked, \u201cIndeed, your menstruation is not in your hand.\u201d.", "commentary": "Menstrual blood is impure, unlike any place that it does not touch it. In this hadith, Abu Hurairah narrated that when the Prophet (\ufdfa) was in his mosque and asked his wife Aisha, who was in her room, to get him the garment or the mat (as in Muslim's narration which is called khumra). It is a small mat that is large enough to be prostrated on and is called khumra, for it covers and isolates one\u2019s face from the ground. Aisha answered that she was menstruating, thinking that all menstruating woman's body was impure so she could neither touch the garment nor enter the mosque. Thus, the Prophet clarified that only the menstrual spot, which is the vulva, was impure, unlike her remaining body. As a result, her hands were pure because they did not menstruate, so she gave him the garment with her hand. Allah had lifted from this Muslim nation the burdens that the Children of Israel had shouldered. They used to get a woman out of her home during menstruation. Additionally, they neither ate nor drank with her. All praise is due to Allah who made us from the nation of the best Prophet.."}, {"number": 121, "hadith": "Aisha said, \"I would drink when I was menstruating then hand it (the vessel) to the Prophet \ufdfa who would put his mouth where mine had been then drink. I would eat flesh from a bone when I was menstruating then hand it to the Prophet \ufdfa who would put his mouth where mine had been.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (\ufdfa) was the best and most merciful one to his family. In this hadith, Aisha, the Mother of the Believers, told us about the Prophet's manners with her while she was menstruating. When she drank and handed the vessel to him, he used to place his mouth and drink from the same place from where she was drinking. Similarly, when she ate flesh from a bone, he used to eat from the same place from where she was eating. All of these manners were to give her comfort, protect her from sadness during this difficult period, kindly deal with her, and confirm that it is Islamically allowable to mix with menstruating women. It was unlike what Jews and people of pre-Islamic ignorant times believed that they neither ate nor drank with her during her period. Finally, this Hadith confirms the Prophet's kindness to his wives, especially during menstruation, for women are in dire need of kindness at that time.."}, {"number": 122, "hadith": "Anas narrated that the Jews, when a woman menstruated, used to leave eating and living with her. The companions asked the Prophet \ufdfa about that, so Allah revealed, \"They ask you concerning menstruation. Say, \"That is a harm,\" therefore keep away from women during menses.\" to the end of the verse (Al-Baqarah: 222). As a result, the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \"Do everything except sexual intercourse.\u201d When the Jews were reported about that, they said, 'This man does not want to leave anything we do without opposing us in it.' Usaid ibn Hudair and \u2018Abbad ibn Beshr came and said, \"O Messenger of Allah \ufdfa, the Jews are saying such and such. Will we not have intercourse with them (i.e. during menstruation)?' The face of Allah's Messenger \ufdfa changed so we thought he was angry with them. When they went out, they were met by a gift of milk which was being brought to the Prophet \ufdfa. He asked for them and gave them a drink. Thereupon, they knew that he was not angry with them.\".", "commentary": "Islam honored women more than any other civilization or system. It granted her rights, status, and a respected opinion. In this hadith, Anas ibn Malik narrated that the Jews, who were living in Medina before the Prophet's advent, used to leave eating or living with menstruating women, believing that they were impure. The Companions asked the Prophet (\ufdfa) about how to treat women during this period, so Allah revealed, \"They ask you concerning menstruation. Say, 'That is a harm,' therefore keep away from women during menses and go not to them till they are purified. And when they have purified themselves, then go into them as Allah has ordained for you. Truly, Allah loves those who turn to Him in repentance and loves those who purify themselves.\" (Al-Baqarah: 222) The meaning is a Muslim has to avoid intercourse with his wife during her menstruation period which is a harm. After her blood stopped and she performed a complete bathing, he was allowed to have intercourse with her in the way that Islam has permitted i.e. penetrating one's penis into her vagina, not her anus. At the end of the verse, Allah confirmed that he loved those who frequently repent and purify. Then, the Prophet (\ufdfa) permitted them to do everything like kissing, embracing, etc. during this period except intercourse. Above all, a Muslim can live and eat with them during this period. In Sahih Muslim, Aisha said, \"I would drink when I was menstruating then hand it (the vessel) to the Prophet (\ufdfa) who would put his mouth where mine had been then drink. I would eat flesh from a bone when I was menstruating then hand it to the Prophet (\ufdfa) who would put his mouth where mine had been.\" When the Jews knew about the Prophet's guidelines, they said, \"This man does not want to leave anything we do without opposing us in it.\" Both the two companions, Usaid Ibn Hudair and 'Abbad ibn Beshr came to the Prophet (\ufdfa) and informed him about the Jews' comment. Due to their anger with the Jews, they asked the Prophet (\ufdfa) to oppose the Jews' habit and have intercourse with menstruating wives. Thereupon, the Prophet's face changed to the point that the attending companions thought he was angry with them both, for his teachings were to clarify Allah's laws in this case not to agree nor contradict any sect in Medina as they both thought. After they went out, he feared that they were sad about what happened. To remove any difficult feelings, he asked them to come back to drink the milk that he received as a gift. Therefore, they knew that he was not angry with them. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It clarifies the Prophet's forbearing and kindness to his companions, (2) It shows that the Prophet (\ufdfa) is only angry when facing something that contradicts Allah's teachings, and (3) It confirms that all Islam's teachings are from Allah.."}, {"number": 123, "hadith": "Abdullah ibn Qais, said, \"I asked Aisha about how the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa used to perform Witr prayer.\" He mentioned the hadith and said, \"I asked her, 'What did he do after having sexual intercourse? Did he take a bath before going to sleep or did he sleep before taking a bath?' She said, 'He did all of these acts. He may have taken a bath then slept or performed ablution then slept.' I said, 'All praise is due to Allah Who has made things easy.'\".", "commentary": "In some acts of worship, the Prophet \ufdfa used to perform them in various methods, as his guidance regarding the night prayer, witr prayer, and bathing after intercourse. All of his acts were a source of guidance for his nation. In this hadith, Abdullah ibn Qais informed that he asked Aisha, the Mother of the Believers, about how the Prophet \ufdfa used to perform Witr prayer. His saying, \u201cHe mentioned the hadith\u201d meant that he wanted to summarize the hadith and mention its other part showing the Prophet\u2019s act after having intercourse at night. In Sunan Abu Daoud, Abdullah narrated the first part in which Aisha answered, \u201cHe may perform witr prayer at the beginning of the night or performed it at its end.\u201d Abdullah asked, \u201cWhat about his recitation? Did he recite in a loud or low voice?\u201d She answered, \u201cHe used to do all of that. Sometimes he recited in a loud voice and sometimes in a low voice.\u201d The Prophet \ufdfa used to perform witr prayer in various ways. He performed it with three, five, seven, nine, and eleven rak\u2019as. He may have recited the Quran during his night prayer in a low voice or a loud voice that those around him could hear. Additionally, Abdullah asked her about the Prophet\u2019s bathing due to intercourse at night. She explained that the Prophet \ufdfa may have taken a bath before sleeping or just performed ablution. Abdullah\u2019s saying: \u201cAll praise is due to Allah Who has made things easy\u201d may be a comment on all of her answers or her answer about the Prophet\u2019s bath after intercourse. This hadith contains the following benefits: (1) Islam facilitated the rules of bathing due to intercourse, (2) It clarified the Muslim predecessors\u2019 keenness to ask about the rules of Islam and follow the Prophet\u2019s acts, deeds, and cases.."}, {"number": 124, "hadith": "Abu Saeed Al-Khudry narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \"When any one of you has intercourse with his wife and wants to repeat it, he should perform ablution.\" In another narration, he added, \"An ablution should be between these two acts.\u201d.", "commentary": "The Prophet (\ufdfa) taught his nation the related matters to intercourse such as its permissible and prohibited acts and how to purify oneself afterward. In this hadith, he guided a husband who had intercourse with his wife to perform ablution if he wanted to do it again before bathing. It was reported in Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah that Abu Saeed Al-Khudry narrated that ablution activated a person to have intercourse once again. Moreover, ablution reduces impurities by cleaning one's penis, which has some benefits: (1) From a medical perspective, it strengthens one's penis, (2) It enables the body to relieve before coming back again, and (3) It completes the pleasure by removing the couple's sperm attached to one\u2019s penis, which may reduce pleasure. It was said that the mentioned ablution referred to only washing a man's penis as exaggerating cleanliness, for it was reported in Sunan Abu Daoud that Aisha (\ufdfa) said, \u201cThe Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) used to sleep after having intercourse without touching water.\u201d Some said that her saying, \u201cwithout touching water\u201d meant bathing which did not contradict ablution. It is possible that the Prophet\u2019s command to perform ablution is, as mentioned, with the aim of seeking cleanliness and activity, for what was reported in Sahih Muslim that Aisha narrated, \"The Prophet (\ufdfa) used to have intercourse with his wives (one after another) with a single bathing.\" She did not mention that he performed ablution. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It is legitimate to perform ablution between two intercourses, whether it is with the same woman or another one, (2) It is not obligatory to perform bathing immediately after intercourse. It is obligatory when wanting to perform acts of worship like prayer which necessitates bathing, and (3) The legitimacy of frequent intercourse.."}, {"number": 125, "hadith": "Aisha narrated that a woman asked the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa), \"Is it obligatory upon a woman to bathe if she has a wet dream and sees her semen?\" He answered, \"Yes.\" Aisha said to her, \"May your hand be covered with dust and injured!\" The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said, \"Leave her alone. Is the resemblance due to something other than that?! If her semen prevails over her husband's, the kid resembles his maternal uncles and if his semen prevails over her semen, the kid resembles his paternal uncles.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (\ufdfa) was a teacher for his nation. He used to teach it all the etiquette of intercourse and purity. In this hadith, Aisha, the Mother of the Believers, narrated that a woman (Umm Sulaim as Anas ibn Malek narrated in Sahih Muslim) asked the Prophet (\ufdfa) if it was obligatory upon a woman to bathe if having a wet dream and seeing semen. He answered, \u201cYes.\u201d He welcomed her question while Aisha expressed her refusal of that type of question. He saw that it was an important religious matter that a person had to inquire about. In Abu Daoud\u2019s narration, he said, \u201cWomen are counterparts of men,\u201d which meant that Islam addressed them with the same legislation as men. Out of his modesty, he implicitly indicated that both genders may have had a wet dream. He thought that the woman understood what he meant through his concise answer. He clarified that the kid resembled his maternal or paternal uncles based on which semen (father\u2019s or mother\u2019s) preceded the other, which was subject to Allah\u2019s will. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It clarifies how the Prophet (\ufdfa) took much care of teaching women the rules of Islam, and (2) It confirms that it is permissible for women to directly ask scholars.."}, {"number": 126, "hadith": "Thawban, the servant of the Prophet \ufdfa, said, \u201cWhile I was standing beside the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa, one of Jews\u2019 rabbis came and said, \u2018Peace be upon you, O Muhammad.\u2019 I pushed him so strongly back that he was about to fall. He said, \u2018Why did you push me?\u2019 I said, \u2018Why did you not say, \u2018O Messenger of Allah?\u2019 The Jew said, \u2018We called him by the name his family named him.\u2019 The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa, said, \u2018My name is Muhammad which my family named me.\u2019 The Jew said, \u2018I came to ask you (something).\u2019 The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u2018Will you benefit from something if I tell you about it?' He said, \u2018I lend my ears to it.\u2019 The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa drew lines on the ground with a stick and said, \u2018Ask.\u2019 The Jew asked, \u2018Where will people be on the Day when the earth changes into another earth and the heavens too?\u2019 The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u2018They will be in darkness beside the Bridge.\u2019 He asked, \u2018Who will be the first to cross?\u2019 The Prophet answered, \u2018The poor immigrants.\u2019 The Jew asked, \u2018What will be their gift when they enter Paradise?\u2019 The Prophet \ufdfa answered, \u2018The side part of a whale\u2019s liver.\u2019 The Jew asked, \u2018What will be their food afterward?\u2019 The Prophet \ufdfa replied, \u2018The Paradise\u2019s bull which is eating from its different quarters will be slaughtered for them.\u2019 The Jew asked, \u2018What will be their drink?\u2019 The Prophet \ufdfa said, \u2018They will drink from a well called Salsabil.\u2019 The Jew said, \u2018You have told the truth. I came to ask you about a thing none among the people on the earth knows except a prophet and one or two men.\u2019 The Prophet \ufdfa said, \u2018Will you benefit if I answer you?\u2019 The Jew, \u2018I lend my ears to it.\u2019 The Jew resumed, \u2018I came to ask you about the kid.\u2019 The Prophet \ufdfa answered, \u2018A man\u2019s sperm is white and a woman\u2019s sperm is yellow. If they gather and the man\u2019s sperm precedes the female's, it will be a male kid, Allah willing. If the woman\u2019s sperm precedes the man's, it will be a female kid, Allah willing. The Jew said, \u2018You have told the truth. Verily, you are a prophet.\u2019 Then he left. The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u2018He asked me about such and such things that I have had no knowledge till Allah gave me that.\u2019\u201d.", "commentary": "The Prophet \ufdfa was a mercy to the worlds. He was a teacher, educator, and caller to Allah with wisdom and good preaching. In this hadith, his servant, Thawban, narrated that a Jewish rabbi came and greeted the Prophet \ufdfa saying, \u201cPeace be upon you, O Muhammad.\u201d Thawban rejected his way of addressing the Prophet \ufdfa by his name and neglecting his description of prophethood. Thawban pushed him so strongly that the Jew was about to fall. When the Jew asked Thawban about the reason for pushing him, Thawban wondered, \u201cWhy did you not say, O Messenger of Allah?\u201d The Jew answered that he called the Prophet \ufdfa by the name his family called him. Thereupon, the Prophet \ufdfa approved his point of view. The name Muhammad means the frequently praised one who has all praised attributes. The Prophet \ufdfa asked him if he wanted to ask to get benefits or aimed to challenge and argue. The Jew confirmed that he was keen to hear and judge the Prophet\u2019s words. The Prophet \ufdfa started to draw lines with a wooden stick on the ground, which was an Arab way during thinking. Then, the Prophet \ufdfa allowed him to ask. The Jew asked about where the people would be on the day when the earth and the heavens would be altered. The Prophet \ufdfa informed him that they would be in the darkness beside the bridge over Hell. In the Two Sahihs, Sahl ibn Sa\u2019d narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \u201cThe people will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection on reddish white land like a pure loaf of bread where none has landmarks.\u201d In addition, the Jew asked who would be the first to cross that bridge so the Prophet \ufdfa answered that they would be his poor companions who immigrated from Mecca to Medina with their faith, left their family and properties, and supported him for Allah\u2019s pleasing. The Jew asked about the gift they would get once getting to Paradise. The Prophet \ufdfa clarified that it would be the side part of a whale\u2019s liver which was the best of its parts. The Jew asked about their lunch (or food as in the other narration) so the Prophet \ufdfa answered that it would be Paradise\u2019s bull which was eating from its different quarters. This referred that it was a bull with unique characteristics that were not similar to other bulls or it was the only bull in Paradise. In the Two Sahihs, Abu Saeed Al-Khudry narrated that the Jew asked the Prophet \ufdfa, \u201cWill I inform you of their food?\u201d The Prophet answered him, \u201cYes.\u201d The Jew answered, \u201cBull and whale. Seventy thousand people will eat from the side part of the whale\u2019s liver.\u201d They may be those seventy persons who will enter Paradise without reckoning so they will be preferred and given the best food. The mentioned number may have meant exaggeration not confining. When the Jew asked the Prophet \ufdfa about their drink after eating that bull, he replied that they would drink from a well called Salsabil in Paradise as Allah Almighty said, \u201cAnd they will be given to drink there of a cup (of wine) mixed with ginger. A spring there, called Salsabil.\u201d (Al-Insan: 17, 18) It water is running so fast. Salsabil means that its water is sweet and easy to enter one\u2019s throat. The Jew believed what the Prophet \ufdfa told and added that he came to ask the Prophet \ufdfa about something none among the people on the earth knew except a prophet and one or two men. It was a metaphor that only a few people knew it. It was known to a prophet or a few persons that a Prophet informed them about it. The Prophet \ufdfa asked him if he wanted to benefit from him if he told him something. The Jew confirmed that he was keen to hear and judge the Prophet\u2019s words. The Jew asked the Prophet \ufdfa about how the embryo's gender was determined. The Prophet \ufdfa answered that the man\u2019s sperm was white and thick while that of the woman was yellow and thin. If they gathered in a woman\u2019s womb and the man\u2019s sperm preceded the female's, it would be a male kid, Allah willing. If the woman\u2019s sperm preceded the man's, it would be a female kid, Allah willing. The Jew confirmed the Prophet\u2019s truthfulness, for all he mentioned was consistent with what he learned from Torah. He also acknowledged the Prophet\u2019s message but did not bear witness to it. This indicates that the mere acknowledgment without belief in Islam has no benefit, for the Prophet did not confirm that the Jew became Muslim. Once the Jew left, the Prophet \ufdfa said that he did not know how to answer the Jew\u2019s questions except after Allah informed him. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It contains some signs that confirm the Prophet\u2019s message, for he told about some matters of the unseen world, (2) The high level of the Prophet\u2019s morals, and (3) It clarifies the virtue of the poor immigrants who Allah will honor with preceding others in crossing the bridge.."}, {"number": 127, "hadith": "Abdullah ibn Abbas narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa used to bath with the water left over by Maimuna (his wife)..", "commentary": "Islam honored women and did not treat them like outcasts, as was the case in pre-Islamic times in which men neither mixed, ate, nor drank with women during menstruation or postpartum, believing their filthiness.

He answered her that it was sufficient that she poured three handfuls of water on her head and then poured water over the rest of her body. If she did that, she would become purified. In another narration, she asked, \"Should I undo it to take a bath due to intercourse or menstruation?\" This narration indicates that a woman does not need to undo her braids during bathing due to intercourse or menstruation. On the other hand, it was said that adding the word \"menstruation\" was not narrated by the most trustworthy narrators. Accordingly, the braids should be undone during bathing due to menstruation, not intercourse.

I never poured more than three handfuls of water over my head.'\".", "commentary": "Facilitation is one of the noble virtues of Islamic law. This facilitation is obvious in various issues such as purification and ablution. In this hadith, Ubeid ibn Umeir Al-Laithy narrated that Aishah heard that Abdullah ibn Amr ibn Al-Aas ordered women to undo their (plaits of) hair while bathing so water would reach all hair. He may have made it obligatory. When she heard that, she wondered and declined his opinion, for it was so difficult that they undo their plaits. So she mocked and added, \"Did he not command them to shave their hair?\" Her proof is that the Prophet (\ufdfa) and she used to bathe from a single vessel. She never poured more than three handfuls of water over her head. Aisha is the most well-known one of these details. On the other hand, there is another related hadith in which Um Salama narrated, \"I asked, \u2019O Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa), I am a woman that braids my head. Should I undo it to take a bath after intercourse?\u2019 He said, \u2018No, it is sufficient that you only pour three handfuls of water on your head and then pour water over the rest of your body so you will be purified.'\" This hadith confirms that a woman is not required to undo her plaits while bathing due to intercourse.."}, {"number": 132, "hadith": "Abu Saeed Al-Khudry narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \"A man must not look at a man's private parts nor must a woman look at a woman's private parts. A man must not lie naked under one cover with another man nor must a woman lie naked under one cover with another woman.\".", "commentary": "Islam blocks all pretexts leading to committing sins and provides humanity with the noblest ideals and the right path to worldly life and the Hereafter. To achieve this goal, Islam commands lowering one\u2019s gaze and forbids looking at private parts, which may lead to committing immoral acts. In this hadith, the Prophet \ufdfa prohibits a man from looking at another man's private parts and also prohibits a woman from looking at another woman's private parts. These teachings involve two commands: (1) Covering one's private parts, and (2) Lowering one\u2019s gaze. Allah pardons the first unintentional glance which may aim to distinguish the way, for example. Islam prohibits us from looking at or touching people's private parts without a need. However, it is permissible to look and touch them if there is a legitimate need such as a medical check, provided that there is a need and without a lust. By the way, this prohibition is not applied to spouses during intercourse. As a rule, a man's private part is from his navel to his knees and a woman's private part is her entire body except her face and hands. On the other hand, the Prophet \ufdfa prohibits a man from lying naked under one cover with another man or a woman lying naked under one cover with another woman, for this will lead to touching their private parts. Undoubtedly, touching them is more prohibited than looking at them, for it leads to greater dangers. This prohibition is specifically mentioned, for some people may think that when men meet each other or women meet each other, they are not commanded to lower their gaze or cover their private parts. One's private parts must be covered for every male or female person, except for some categories that Islam excludes.."}, {"number": 133, "hadith": "Al-Meswar ibn Makhrama said, \"While I was walking and carrying a heavy stone, both my light lower garment and the stone fell. I could not place the stone until I put it in its proper place. The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said to me, 'Return and wear your garment and do not walk naked.\".", "commentary": "Modesty is the manner of Islam. Allah prescribed for His servants what preserves their modesty and covers their private parts. In this hadith, Al-Meswar ibn Makhrama narrated that while he was carrying a heavy stone, his lower garment's tie loosed so his private parts were exposed. He was unable to place the stone and tie his garment because of its heavy weight. He continued to carry it until he placed it in its proper place. When the Prophet (\ufdfa) saw that, he commanded him to go back and wear his garment to cover his private parts. The Prophet (\ufdfa) added, \"... and do not walk naked.\" This is a general Islamic rule. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) A Muslim has to cover his private parts, (2) It is forbidden for Muslims to be or walk naked in front of people except being naked in front of a woman's husband or man's wife.."}, {"number": 134, "hadith": "Abdullah ibn Ga'far narrated, \"The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa one day made me mount behind him and confided to me something secret which I would not disclose to anybody.

In this hadith, Abdullah ibn Ga'far narrated that the Prophet (\ufdfa) one day made him mount behind him and confided to him something secret. Ga\u2019far was honest and would not disclose it to anybody. This indicated his perfect virtue and supreme status with the Prophet to the extent that he let him in on a secret. Afterward, Abdullah narrated, \"The thing that the Prophet most liked to conceal himself behind while relieving himself was a hillock or a stand of date palm trees.\" It was the Arabs' custom that they relieved themselves in gardens but they later used bathrooms. Finally, this hadith confirms the importance of concealing all one's body while answering the call of nature.."}, {"number": 135, "hadith": "Abu Saeed Al-Khudry narrated, \"I went to Quba' with the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) on Monday.

The Prophet (\ufdfa) was keen to teach his companions the matters of purification and they used to ask him about any inquiries they had. In this hadith, Abu Saeed Al-Khudry narrated that he went out with the Prophet (\ufdfa) on Monday to Quba\u2019. It is a close village located south of Media on the way of coming caravans from Mecca. When they arrived at Banu Salem, a sect of Khazraj tribe, The Prophet (\ufdfa) stood at the door of Itban bin Malik Al-Ansari and called him in a loud voice. As a result, Itban came out dragging his lower garment, which is a metaphor for his rapid response to the Prophet (\ufdfa). The Prophet (\ufdfa) thought he made Itban haste. Itban asked the Prophet (\ufdfa) about the necessity of bathing if a man left his wife suddenly during intercourse without ejaculation. The Prophet (\ufdfa) confirmed that bathing is only obligatory if a man ejaculates. This rule was applied at the beginning of Islam, then abrogated by the hadith reported in the Two Sahihs that Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \u201cWhen a man sits between her four parts (his wife) and has intercourse, bathing is compulsory.\" In Muslim\u2019s narration, he said, \"Even if he does not ejaculate.\u201d So, bathing is obligatory for anyone who has intercourse with his wife, whether or not he ejaculates semen. It was the established rule during or after the Prophet's lifetime.

Out of establishing the principle of graduation, it sometimes abrogates some established rules. In this hadith, Abdullah ibn Ash-Shekhir, one of Basra scholars, confirmed this principle with relating to the Prophet's Sunnah. It was legislated at the beginning that ablution was sufficient for a Muslim who had intercourse with his wife without ejaculation, as in the two Sahihs that Ubayy ibn Ka\u2019b said, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) about a man who had intercourse with his wife but left her before orgasm. He said, 'He should wash what he had (on his body) from his wife (her discharge), perform ablution, and offer prayer.'\" Later, it was abrogated and established that bathing is obligatory after intercourse, whether or not, a person ejaculates. The Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \"If he sits between her four limbs, bathing is obligatory.\u201d (Bukhari & Muslim) As for the Quran, it was, at the beginning, established that a woman is confined to her home as a punishment if she commits adultery. Allah, the Almighty, says, \"And those of your women who commit illegal sexual intercourse, take the evidence of four witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them (i.e. women) to houses until death comes to them or Allah ordains for them some (other) way.\" (An-Nisa) It was later abrogated by the verse, \"The fornicatress and the fornicator, flog each of them with a\u2009hundred stripes.\" (An-Nur: 2) Also, the Prophet (\ufdfa) clarified this rule and said, \"Learn from me. Allah has ordained for them another way. A virgin is punished with one hundred lashes and exiled for one year. A Thayyib (divorcee or widow) is punished with one hundred lashes and stoning.\u201d (Narrated by Muslim) Finally, this hadith shows the interest of the Companions' students to study the Prophetic Sunnah, including the cases of abrogation.."}, {"number": 137, "hadith": "Abu Musa said, \u201cSome of Al-Ansar (Helpers) and some of Muhajeroun (Immigrants) had different opinions about bathing after intercourse.

He went to Aisha, the Mother of the believers, passionately addressed her by her nickname of maternity, and modestly asked her about her opinion. She answered, \"Do not feel shy of asking me about something which you can ask your mother who gave you birth, for I am too your mother,\" for Allah said in the Quran, \"The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are their (believers\u2019) mothers.\u201d (Al-Ahzab: 6). When he asked her about what made bathing obligatory, she answered, \"You have asked the well-informed one.\" She narrated that the Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \"If he sits between her four limbs (the woman) and the circumcision touches the circumcision, bathing is obligatory.\" He means that if a man sits between his wife's hands and legs and his penis penetrates her vagina, bathing is obligatory for both, whether or not, he ejaculates, as in Sahih Muslim that Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet (\ufdfa) added, \"Even if he does not ejaculate.\u201d Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It clarifies how the Companions are keen on discussing and learning to get the truth, (2) It shows their morals and appreciation of Aisha\u2019s position and knowledge, for they were keen on learning from her, and (3) It confirms the obligation of bathing when a man's and woman's circumcisions touch.."}, {"number": 138, "hadith": "Aisha, the Prophet's wife, narrated, \"A man asked the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa about one who has sexual intercourse with his wife but does not ejaculate due to listlessness.

The same man also asked the Prophet about: (1) Performing ablution due to eating its meat, and (2) Praying in camel's folds. The Prophet replied that it was necessary for a Muslim to perform ablution due to eating camel's meat. Also, he forbade us from praying in their folds. As for the cause of this prohibition, scholars mentioned the following potential reasons: (1) A camel sometimes has a sudden strong behavior so it may hurt, confuse, or interrupt the praying one, so he is being afraid that it may trample and kill him, and (2) Camels' folds are full of filths and contain deeply terrible smell. Imam Abu Daoud narrated in his Sunan that the Prophet said, \"Do not pray in camels' folds, for they are the places of devils.\" So, devils are whispering to the praying ones in these folds.

He said that he lived in the western regions with Barbarians, who were like Bedouins in cruelty and harshness, and Magus, Fire worshippers. They brought rams they slaughtered in a way that contradicted the Islamic way, but Abderrahman did not eat them, for they were not among the People of the Book whose sacrifices were permissible in Islam. They also brought waterskin full of fat and melted tallow. They were vessels made of skins of the slaughtered animals.

He wanted to ask him if it was permissible to use it for drinking or putting meat fat. Ibn Abbas confirmed that the Companions asked the Prophet (\ufdfa) about that who told them that the skin of a dead animal was purified by tanning. Tanning is to remove anything after the skinning process so it does not contradict salt or preservatives. Afterward, it is permissible to eat, drink, and use it in all allowable ways.

In a narration of Abu Daoud, Anas said, \"until their heads lowered down.\" This means that their heads lowered down due to dozing while they were waiting for prayer. His saying, \"... without repeating ablution.\" is a confirmation that they did not repeat their ablution, for while they were dozing, they were aware of what was around them.

Its words combine the Islamic doctrine of monotheism. In this hadith, Abu Mahthura narrated the words of the call to prayer as the Prophet (\ufdfa) taught him when being appointed as a governor of Mecca in the eighth year after the Battle of Hunein. Although being concise, \u201cAllah is the greatest\" refers to His perfection and negates any meaning that may contradict so. It may mean that Allah is too great that we can realize His greatness. The testimony of faith has two parts. The first one is to prove monotheism, mean that no god worthy of worship except Allah, and negate its opposite of having any partnership. It is the testimony that has precedence and priority over any other issue in Islam. The other part is to declare and prove the message of Prophet Muhammad (\ufdfa), which directly comes after the testimony of Allah\u2019s oneness. Afterward, the caller urges Muslims twice to come to perform prayer, which mentioned after proving the Prophet's message, for we know the obligation of prayer from the Prophet\u2019s teachings, not due to human realization. Then, the caller commands Muslims twice to come to success, victory, and permanent bliss, which reminds them of the events of the hereafter like resurrection and reckoning. In Abu Daoud's narration, the Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \"If it is Dawn (Fajr) prayer, you should say, 'Prayer is better than sleeping, prayer is better than sleeping.'\" At the end, he concluded the call with, \"Allah is the Greatest\" twice then said, \"There is no god but Allah.\" In narrations in Sunan Abu Daoud and An-Nasa'i, he mentioned \"Allah is the Greatest\" four times in the beginning. The words of the call to prayer are repeated more than once to make sure that lots of people know about the prayer time.

In this hadith, Aisha, the Mother of the Believers, narrated that Abdullah ibn Umm Maktoum, his name is Abdullah ibn Qais ibn Za'ida Al-Qurashi and he is the cousin of Khadija, the Mother of the Believers, was a blind man whose job was to call people to prayer. The Prophet (\ufdfa) assigned Bilal ibn Rabah to call to prayer along with Abdullah for the following cause. When the Companions secluded and prayed at night in Ramadan in the Prophetic mosque, they were surprised by the call to Fajr (Dawn) prayer before taking a rest and having suhour meal as a preparation to fast. Some may have dozed off before bathing due to intercourse. As a result, the Prophet (\ufdfa) decided that Bilal called to Fajr prayer before its time to alert those praying or sleeping. At Fajr time, Bilal descended from the place of call then Abdullah ascended to call to prayer so that people refrained from eating suhour and prepared themselves for Fajr prayer. This is explained by the narration of the two Sahihs in which Abdullah ibn Omar narrated that the Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \"Verily, Bilal calls to prayer at night, so you can keep eating (suhour) and drinking until Ibn Um Maktoum calls.\" Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) A blind man\u2019s call to prayer is valid on condition that he has someone telling him about its time, (2) It confirms the legitimacy of a man\u2019s lineage to his mother as long as it becomes famous and there is a need for it, (3) It refers to the legitimacy of describing a person with a flaw for the purpose of definition or other benefits, not to belittle him, and (4) It shows the legitimacy of appointing two callers to prayer in one mosque.."}, {"number": 151, "hadith": "Anas ibn Malek narrated, \"The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa used to attack (enemies) when it was dawn. He used to wait for the prayer call. If he heard the prayer call, he stopped, otherwise he attacked. One day, he heard a man saying, 'Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest,' so the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, '(He is) following the human instinct.' Then, he heard him saying, 'I testify that there is no god but Allah. I testify that there is no god but Allah.' The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, 'You came out of Hell.' When they looked (at him), they found him a goat herd.\".", "commentary": "Allah, out of His wisdom, legislated that people call for the five daily prayers at their times. It is one of the apparent Islamic rites that indicates that the people who live in this place are Muslims and perform prayer, an Islamic pillar. In this hadith, Anas ibn Malek narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa did not invade his enemies except after it was dawn. He used to defer invading them till the time of dawn prayer\u2019s call. If he heard it, he would stop, for it was a sign that they were Muslims or had a reconciliation with him to let Muslims of that village perform rites of Islam. If he did not hear it, it would be a sign that they were disbelievers so he decided to invade them. One time, when reaching a village to invade it, he heard a man saying the prayer\u2019s call, \u201cAllah is the greatest, Allah is the greatest.\u201d The Prophet \ufdfa said, \u201c(He is) following the human instinct.\u201d Islam is the human instinct and the straight religion on which all babies are born. Then, the caller said twice, \u201cI testify that there is no god but Allah.\u201d He proved Allah\u2019s oneness and negated all types of polytheism that Allah did not deserve. Allah's oneness is the core of Islam that comes over all of its rites. It means that there is no god worthy of worship but Allah. The Prophet \ufdfa commented, \u201cYou came out of Hell.\u201d i.e. due to this statement of monotheism. When the companions looked at the man, they found him a goat herd that called for prayer in the desert when its time began. It was narrated in Sahih Bukhari that Abu Saeed Al-Khudry said to Abdullah ibn Abderrahman ibn Abi Sa\u2019sa\u2019ah, \u201cI see you are fond of sheep and the desert, so when you want to say the prayer call, raise your voice, for whoever hears the range of the caller\u2019s voice, a human, a Jinn, or anything else, will bear witness to him on the Day of Resurrection.\u201d This hadith shows the legitimacy of saying the prayer call by a person who prays alone.."}, {"number": 152, "hadith": "Abdullah ibn Amr ibn Al-Aas narrated that he heard the Prophet (\ufdfa) saying, \u201cWhen you hear the caller to prayer, repeat what he is saying, then ask Allah to exalt my mention, for whoever asks Allah to exalt my mention Allah will exalt his mention tenfold. Then, ask Allah to give me the wasila, which is a rank in Paradise that only one of Allah's servants will attain. I hope I will be that one. If anyone asks (Allah to grant me) the Wasila, he will be assured of my intercession.\u201d.", "commentary": "This hadith shows the virtue of exalting the Prophet's mention after the call to prayer. He urged us to repeat what the caller said, except his saying, \"Come to prayer, come to success,\" the listener said, \u201cThere is no power nor strength except in Allah,\" as in Sahih Muslim. Afterward, the Prophet (\ufdfa) showed that whoever exalted his mention Allah would praise him with his angels tenfold. He urged us to ask Allah to grant him the prestige of Wasilah, which was a status in Paradise that only one would attain. The Prophet (\ufdfa) hoped he would attain this prestige. As a result, it is recommended to say, as in Bukhari, after the call for prayer, \"O Allah, God of this perfect call and established prayer. Grant Muhammad (\ufdfa) the intercession and favor, and raise him to the honored station You have promised him.\" Whoever asks Allah, after every call for prayer, to grant this status to the Prophet (\ufdfa) will be assured of his intercession. His intercession will be for: (1) Sinful Muslims to enter Paradise without accountability, (2) Raising some People's status in Paradise, and (3) Getting some Muslims out of Hell after they deserve it.."}, {"number": 153, "hadith": "Omar ibn Al-Khattab narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \"When the caller to prayer says, 'Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest,\u2019 and one of you responds, 'Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest,\u2019 then the caller says, 'I testify that there is no god but Allah,\u2019 and one of you responds, 'I testify that there is no god but Allah,\u2019 then the caller says, 'I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah,\u2019 and one of you responds, 'I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah,\u2019 then the caller says, 'Come to prayer,' one of you responds, 'There is neither might nor power except with Allah,' then the caller says, 'Come to salvation,' and one of you responds, 'There is neither might nor power except with Allah,\u2019 then the caller says, 'Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest,' and one of you responds, 'Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest,' then the caller says, 'There is no god but Allah,' and one of you heartedly responds, 'There is no god but Allah,' he will enter Paradise.'\".", "commentary": "The aim of azan (call to prayer) is to inform people about its exact time. The call words are comprehensive for the Islamic doctrine of faith. In this hadith, the Prophet (\ufdfa) commands Muslims to repeat what the caller is saying. Despite its being short, the sentence, \u201cAllah is the greatest\" refers to His perfection and negates any meaning that may contradict so. It may mean that He is too great that we can realize His greatness. The testimony of faith has two parts. The first one is to prove monotheism, mean that no god worthy of worship except Allah, and negate its opposite of having any partnership. It is the testimony that has precedence and priority over any other issue in Islam. The other part is to declare and prove the message of Prophet Muhammad (\ufdfa), which directly comes after the testimony of Allah\u2019s oneness. Afterward, the caller urges Muslims twice to come to perform prayer, which mentioned after proving the Prophet's message, for we know the obligation of prayer from the Prophet\u2019s teachings, not due to human realization. Then, the caller commands Muslims twice to come to success, victory, and permanent bliss. After these two sentences, the listener should say, \u201cThere is neither might nor power except with Allah.\u201d It is as if a Muslim confirmed his weakness that he had no help with prayer or success except through Allah's support. In the end, the Prophet (\ufdfa) confirms that whoever repeats, with his tongue and heart, what the call says will enter Paradise, for repeating these words confirms the oneness of Allah along with glorifying, obeying, surrendering, praising, trusting, and seeking His help. Finally, this hadith urges Muslims to sincerity and encourages them to repeat the words of the call to prayer.."}, {"number": 154, "hadith": "Saad ibn Abi Waqqas narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \"If anyone says when hearing the caller to prayer, 'I testify that there is no god but Allah alone Who has no partner and that Muhammad is His servant and His Messenger. I am satisfied with Allah as my Lord, Muhammad as a Messenger, and Islam as a religion, his sins will be forgiven.'\" In another narration, \"And I testify ...\".", "commentary": "Allah preferred some times to others and made supplications on them subject to be responded by Him. In addition, he determined specific supplications for specific times such as those said by a Muslim after the prayer call. In this hadith, the Prophet (\ufdfa) said that if a Muslim says after a prayer call, \"I testify that there is no god but Allah alone Who has no partner,\" which means I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship but Allah alone, with no partner in his kingdom or worship. He added, \u201cand that Muhammad is His servant and His Messenger,\" in which he was described as a servant, for he reached the ultimate level of humility and submission to Allah and was the most pious of all creation, so none has ever reached his level of humility and submission to his Lord but him. Moreover, he was linguistically added to His Lord in the same context out of honor. Also, he added, \u201cI am satisfied with Allah as my Lord,\" which means I am satisfied with His lordship and decrees. He added, \u201cand Muhammad as a Messenger,\" which means to believe in all laws with which he was sent. Also, he said, \u201cand Islam as a religion,\" which means all of its rules, commands, and prohibitions. Finally, he concluded, \u201c\u2026 his sins will be forgiven,\" which means that his minor sins will be forgiven. In Sahih Ibn Khuzeima and Sahih ibn Hibban, he said, \u201cAll of his previous sins will be forgiven.\u201d."}, {"number": 155, "hadith": "Mu'aweya ibn Abu Sufian said that he heard the Prophet \ufdfa said, \"The callers to prayer will have the longest necks of all people on the Day of Resurrection.\".", "commentary": "Calling to prayer is a venerable Islamic rite for which Allah honored and favored the callers to it with great rewards, which the issue that made the Companions look forward to this favor. In this hadith, the Prophet clarified the virtues of the callers that they would have the longest necks of all people on the Day of Resurrection. This means one of the following meanings: (1) They will be the most yearning people for Allah's mercy, for the one yearning for something is trying to lengthen his neck toward what he is looking forward to, (2) When people are covered with their sweat on the Day of Resurrection, the callers\u2019 necks will lengthen to avoid this distress, or (3) They are the leaders of all people, for the Arabs used to describe gentlemen with long necks. Finally, this hadith shows the virtues of the callers to prayer over all people on the Day of Resurrection.."}, {"number": 156, "hadith": "Jaber narrated, \"I heard the Prophet \ufdfa saying, \"When the devil hears the call to prayer, he goes away till he gets Ar-Rauha\u2019.\u201d Suleiman said, \"I asked him about Ar-Rauha' so he answered, \"It is thirty-six miles from Medina.\".", "commentary": "Satan's goal is to seduce people and turn them away from Allah's path and monotheism. As a result, it is so difficult for him to hear the call to prayer, for it includes calling for monotheism and declaring the slogan of Islam. In this hadith, the Prophet (\ufdfa) confirms that when the call to prayer is announced, Satan goes far away to a distant place called, \"Ar-Rauha'\" which is a valley about 80 kilometers from Medina and about 25 kilometers in length between Medina and Mecca. This means Satan goes far away from the praying person as the distance between Medina and Ar-Rawha\u2019. The Prophet (\ufdfa) used to rest there during traveling to perform pilgrimage or umrah and returning from a battle. This hadith confirms that Satan moves far away from the place where the call to prayer is delivered as shown in another narration of this hadith in the Two Sahihs that the Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \"When the call to prayer is finished, he comes back, and when the Iqama is delivered, he goes far away again, and when the Iqama is finished, he comes back again.\" Finally, this hadith shows the virtue and effects of the call to prayer on escaping Satan and keeping his whisperings away from the praying person.."}, {"number": 157, "hadith": "Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \"If anyone performs a prayer in which he does not recite Umm Al-Quran (Al-Fatihah), it is deficient [thrice] and incomplete.\" Someone asked Abu Hurairah, \"What if we pray behind an imam?\" He said, \"Recite it in a quiet voice, for I heard the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa saying, \"Allah, the Most-High, said, \"I have divided the prayer into two halves between Me and My servant and My servant will receive what he asks. When the servant recites, \"All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds,\" Allah, the Most-High, says, \"My servant has praised Me.\" When he recites, \"The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful,\" Allah, the Most-High, says, \"My servant has lauded Me.\" When he recites, \"Master of the Day of Judgment,\" Allah says, \"My servant has glorified Me\" or \"My servant entrusted (his affairs) to Me.\" When he recites, \"You alone we worship and You Alone we ask for help,\" Allah says, \"This is between Me and My servant, and My servant will receive what he asks.\" When he recites, \"Guide us to the Straight path. The Way of those on whom You have bestowed Your Grace, not (the way) of those who earned Your Anger, nor of those who went astray,\" Allah says, \"This is for my servant and he will receive what he asks.\".", "commentary": "Prayer is worship that can be only learned from the Islamic texts. Thus, the Prophet (\ufdfa) verbally and practically taught Muslims its pillars and rules. In this hadith, Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \"If anyone performs a prayer in which he does not recite Umm Al-Quran (Al-Fatihah), it is deficient [thrice] and incomplete.\" He repeated it thrice as a confirmation of its importance. Reciting Surat Al-Fatihah is for the imam and a Muslim who prays alone is one of the pillars of prayer. Someone asked Abu Hurairah about what they should recite behind an imam, so he answered that they have to recite it in a quiet voice, for this Prophetic hadith. Allah called Surat Al-Fatihah prayer, for it is one of its obligatory prerequisites. Allah mentioned that the prayer becomes two halves, for its first half is to praise Allah while the other is to supplicate Him who responds to his servant. It is likely that Allah told this conversation to his angels. His saying, \"My servant has praised me\" confirms that Allah accepted the servant's praise. His saying, \"My servant has lauded me\" means that the servant acknowledges Allah's grants to his creatures. His saying, \"My servant has glorified me\" refers that glory is the supreme honor which is better than just praising. His saying, \"This is between Me and My servant, and My servant will receive what he asks\" after his saying, \"You alone we worship and You Alone we ask for help,\" shows that the first half is to acknowledge Allah's divinity while worshipping him but the other half is to ask Allah for help. His saying, \"Guide us to the Straight path. The Way of those on whom You have bestowed Your Grace, not (the way) of those who earned Your Anger, nor of those who went astray,\" and his answer, \"This is for my servant and he will receive what he asks\" refers to a deep supplication from the servant and a response from Allah. The most likely opinion is that it is not obligatory for a person in a loud congregational prayer to recite Al-Fatihah, so he has to listen to his imam's recitation after Al-Fatihah, for Allah's saying, \"So, when the Qur\u2019\u0101n is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy.\" (Al-A\u2019raf: 204). In Sunan An-Nasa'i, Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet said, \"The imam is appointed only to be followed, so when he says the takbir, say it also and when he recites, listen silently.\u201d Finally, this hadith proves Allah's attribute of speech in the manner that befits Him, Glory be to Him.."}, {"number": 158, "hadith": "Imran ibn Husain narrated that while the Prophet \ufdfa was praying Zuhr prayer, a person recited, \"Exalt the name of your Lord, the Most-High.\" behind him.

Thus, the Prophet (\ufdfa) verbally and practically taught Muslims its pillars and rules. In this hadith, Imran ibn Husein narrated that when the prophet (\ufdfa) once led Muslims in Dhuhr prayer and a man behind was loudly reciting Surat Al-A'la, the Prophet (\ufdfa) declined his way and asked, after finishing his prayer, about who was reciting behind. A man answered, \"It was me.\" The Prophet (\ufdfa) said to him, \"I thought as if someone amongst you was disputing with me (in what I was reciting).\" He was confused by this man\u2019s recitation, so he denounced his loud recitation, not his absolute recitation. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) A Muslim can recite a Quranic sura after Surat Al-Fatihah in silent prayers, and (2) It warns a praying Muslim against reciting the Quran loudly behind his imam in silent and audible prayers.."}, {"number": 159, "hadith": "Abda narrated that Umar ibn Al-Khattab used to loudly say these words, \"Subhanaka Allahumma wa bi hamdika wa tabaraka esmuka wa ta'ala jadduka wa la ilaha ghairuka\" (Glory be to You, O Allah and Yours is the praise! Blessed is Your Name! Exalted is Your Majesty! No god but You).", "commentary": "Prayer is the most important Islamic pillar. It should be completely and perfectly performed as Allah commanded. The Prophet's Companions were keen to learn and teach people its rules. In this hadith, Omar used to loudly say the opening supplication in prayer to instruct people behind. The supplication \"Subhanaka Allahumma wa bi hamdika\" means that we glorify Allah while praising Him. Some scholars said that glorifying Allah came before praising Him, for glorifying is to exalt Him above all deficiencies while praising is to commend Him for his perfect attributes. As a rule, praising someone for his noble attributes should be preceded by making sure to avoid falsely describing him with unrealistic attributes. The supplication \"tabaraka esmuka\" means that blessed is Your Name. The supplication \"ta'ala jadduka\" means exalted is Your Majesty. In the Four Books of Sunan, Abu Saeed Al-Khudry narrated that the Prophet (\ufdfa) said the same supplication, but without saying them loudly. Omar may have loudly said it to instruct people behind, as narrated in Abderrazzaaq's Musannaf (hadith collection) that \"Omar used to teach people that after a Muslim begins praying, he should say, \u2018Subhanaka Allahumma wa bi hamdika wa tabaraka esmuka wa ta'ala jadduka wa la ilaha ghairuka.\u2019\u201d (Glory be to You, O Allah and Yours is the praise!

This may refer that they recited it quietly so none of the praying ones behind could hear it. It may also refer that they did not recite it but directly started reciting Surat Al-Fatihah. The preferred opinion is that a Muslim should secretly recite it before Surat Al-Fatihah and every sura afterward. In another narration in Sahih Muslim, Anas ibn Malek narrated, \"They used to begin with 'All praise is due to Allah' and did not recite, 'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful' neither before the first recitation nor the second one.\u201d It was narrated that some Companions thought that loudly reciting \"Bismillah-ir-Rahman-ir-Rahim\" was better, including Abu Hurairah, Ibn Omar, Ibn Abbas, and Ibn Al-Zubayr.."}, {"number": 161, "hadith": "Anas ibn Malek narrated, \u201cThe Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) dozed for a short while (in a narration, \u201cin the mosque\u201d) and raised his head smiling.

In the hadith, Anas ibn Malek narrated that the Prophet (\ufdfa) dozed for a short while among them in the mosque, which was his state while receiving revelation. When he raised his head smiling, his Companions asked him about the reason. He clarified that Surat Al-Kawthar had just been revealed to him. The surah means: We gave you, O Messenger, a lot of goodness, including Al-Kawthar which is a river in Paradise. So give thanks to God for this blessing by praying and slaughtering to him alone. The one who hates you is the one who is cut off from all goodness, the forgotten one, and who, if mentioned, is mentioned with evil. While the Prophet and the faithful are drinking from it, a man will be expelled and taken away. At that moment, the Prophet will ask Allah to bring him back but he will be answered that he does not know the heresies his nation invented after his death. They disobeyed Allah's orders and committed forbidden acts. May Allah grant us steadfastness in Islam and Prophetic tradition! These mentioned people may: (1) Have left Islam so they deserved the Prophet's renunciation, (2) Have committed major sins or dangerous heresies. He may turn away from them and decide not to intercede for them in fulfilling Allah's command, so they will be punished for their crimes. He may later intercede for them as he will do regarding the believing people who committed major sins and will be later brought out of Hell. This is a severe threat to everyone who introduces something into Islam that he may be expelled from the Prophet's basin. Some of these groups are those opposing Muslim nation like Kharijites, the Shiites, people of forbidden desires, and the oppressors trying to conceal the truth and publically commit major sins.

Afterward, he lifted his hands, said takbeer, and bowed. When he stood, he said, \"Allah hears whoever praises Him.\" It is a supplication that means, \"O Allah!

Its first sentence is to say, \u201cAll blessed services\u201d which means dominion and greatness. \u201cPrayers\u201d is the supplication, the five daily prayers, or mercy. \u201cThe good deeds\u201d are the righteous deeds that a servant dedicates to Allah only or those words he says to praise Him. \u201cGreeting (peace), mercy, and blessings of Allah are upon you, O Prophet \ufdfa. Greeting (peace) is upon us and upon the upright servants of Allah\u201d means to greet the Prophet \ufdfa and all righteous servants. By the way, Peace is one of Allah\u2019s names which has two meanings: (1) Seeking Allah\u2019s refuge and protection and (2) Negating any defects that people may attribute to Allah. The Prophet \ufdfa taught them to particularly greet him, out of honor and high prestige, great themselves, and generally greet all the righteous. The righteous are those fulfilling Allah\u2019s and his servants\u2019 rights. Then, he completed the at-tashahhud by saying, \u201cI bear witness that there is no god but Allah,\u201d and added, as narrated by Ibn Omar in Sunan Abu Daoud, \u201calone without a partner of Him.\u201d It means that a Muslim acknowledges and approves that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah, the Almighty. His saying, \u201cAnd I bear witness that Muhammad is Allah\u2019s Messenger,\u201d means that a Muslim believes that Muhammad is the Messenger that Allah sent. He is not a liar, magician, or fortune teller, as the infidels say. Thus, a Muslim approves the Prophet\u2019s message in every prayer. The other part of at-tashahhud is to exalt the Prophet\u2019s mention.

He said, \u2018O Hettan, perhaps you said it?\u2019 I answered, \u2018No. I did not say it. I was afraid that you may have blamed me on account of it.\u2019 A man amongst the people said, \u2018I said it and intended nothing but good.\u2019 Abu Musa said, \u2018Do not you know what you should say during your prayers? Verily, the Prophet \ufdfa once addressed and explained to us how to observe prayer. He said, \u2018When you want to pray, make your rows straight and let one of you lead you. When he (the imam) says takbir, you say takbir. When he recites, \u2018Not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray.\u2019 (Al-Fatihah: 7), you say, \u2018Ameen\u2019 and Allah will respond to you. When he says takbir and bows, you say takbir and bow, for he bows and then raises himself before you. This makes up for that. When he says, \u2018Allah listens to whom praises Him,\u2019 you should say, \u2018O Allah, our Lord, to you is the praise.\u2019 Allah will listen to you. Allah, the Almighty, said as his Prophet \ufdfa narrated, \u2018Allah listens to whom praises Him.\u2019 When he (the Imam) says takbir and prostrates, you say takbir and prostrate, for he prostrates and then raises himself before you. This makes up for that. When he sits (to say at-tashahhud), you should say, \u2018All good services and prayers are due to Allah. Peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah are upon you, O Prophet \ufdfa. Peace be upon us and upon the upright servants of Allah. I testify that there is no god but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and His Messenger.\u2019 In another narration, he said, \u201cAllah, the Almighty, commanded it through his Prophet\u2019s tongue, \u2018Allah listens to whom praises Him.\u2019\u201d.", "commentary": "1605\nPrayer is the pillar of Islam, so the Prophet \ufdfa taught us how to perform it and say its supplications. After his death, his companions were keen to teach people all acts of worship. In this hadith, Hettan ibn Abdullah Ar-Raqashy related that he once prayed behind the Prophet\u2019s companion Abu Musa Al-Ash\u2019ary. When he was in the last setting, one of the praying men said, \u201cThe prayer was associated with goodness and Zakat.\u201d He meant that it was associated with the in the Quran as obligatory acts. Once Abu Musa ended his prayer, he asked about that person but none answered then he repeated his question but also none answered. Abu Musa thought that Hettan was that person but the latter hastened to negate that to avoid Abu Musa\u2019s blaming. Abu Musa thought it was Hettan, for the similarity of voices or that Hettan was a close friend to Abu Musa, so he could say that. Afterward, one of the praying men confirmed that he himself said that sentence and intended nothing but good. Abu Musa was surprised that he did not know what was allowed or disallowed in prayer. As a result, Abu Musa told the attendants that the Prophet \ufdfa once addressed his companions to explain to them prayer along with some Islamic rites. The Prophet \ufdfa commanded them to stand on prayer rows straightly, complete the first line then the second and so on, and let one of them lead them. He (the imam) should be the most in jurisprudence and memorizing the Qur\u2019an, as the Prophetic narrations showed. The Prophet \ufdfa clarified that if the imam said \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d at the beginning of prayer, people said \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d afterward. If he recited Surat Al-Fatihah entirely, people said, \u201cAmen\u201d which meant, \u201cO Allah, Respond.\u201d If they did that, Allah would answer their supplication. If he bowed, people bowed afterward. It is forbidden to precede him in any move. The moment he precedes people in bowing will be got when he raised himself and says \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d then they follow him. So, all spend the same time in bowing. If the imam said, \u201cSame\u2019a Allahu leman hamedahu (it means may Allah listen to whom praises Him,\u2019 people said, \u201cO Allah, our Lord, to you is the praise.\u201d It may be a supplication from the imam for the people behind him or he informs them about Allah\u2019s grace. Both the imam and a person who prays alone should say the two sentences but the one behind the imam says the second sentence only. It was said that the latter said the two sentences as well. If they, the praying ones, said that, Allah listened to their supplication and their words. The Prophet \ufdfa also clarified how to prostrate as he did for bowing. He also taught his companions the words of at-tashahhud before ending prayer. It means that Allah is deserved all kind words of greatness, praise, glorification, and sovereignty. He is deserved that people direct to him in their righteous deeds of worship and prayers. Then, the praying one is guided to send his greeting (peace) to the Prophet \ufdfa along with asking Allah\u2019s mercy and blessings to him as well due to his honor and high right. He also greets himself and all righteous slaves of Allah. Peace is one of Allah\u2019s names. It means seeking refuge in Him or being safe from any defect and corruption. Also, the praying one should declare the testimony of monotheism, \u201cI bear witness that there is no god but Allah.\u201d The Prophet \ufdfa added, \u201cAlone without a partner\u201d as in ibn Omar\u2019s narration in Sunan Abu Daoud. It means that I acknowledge that there is no truly worshiped god except Allah. He also says, \u201cAnd I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.\u201d It means that I believe that Muhammad is a messenger sent from Allah. He was neither a liar nor a magician as polytheists claimed. This is the first half of at-tashahhud. In the other half, a person exalts the Prophet\u2019s mention. In the Two Sahihs, Ka'b ibn 'Ojra narrated, \"The Prophet \ufdfa came to us and we asked him, 'O Messenger of Allah, we knew how to greet you, but how should we supplicate for you?' He said, 'Say, 'Allahumma salli 'ala Muhammadin, wa 'ala 'ali Muhammadin, kama sallaita 'ala 'ali Ibrahima, innaka Hamidun Majid. Allahumma barek 'ala Muhammadin, wa 'ala 'ali Muhammadin, kama barakta 'ala 'ali Ibrahima, innaka Hamidun Majid.'\" It means, \"O Allah, exalt the mention of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as you exalted the family of Ibrahim. You are Praised and Glorious. O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as You blessed the family of Ibrahim. You are Praised and Glorious.\u201d This hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It commands us to straighten prayer rows, (2) It is recommended to say \u201cAmen\u201d after the imam recites Surat Al-Fatihah, (3) The praying ones have to immediately following their imam in bowing and prostrating, and (4) It clarifies the words of At-tashahhud.."}, {"number": 165, "hadith": "Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \u201cIf anyone exalts my mention once, Allah will exalt his mention ten times.\u201d.", "commentary": "Due to Allah\u2019s honor of his Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa, He made the testimony of proving His oneness is linked to the testimony of proving the Prophet\u2019s message. It is Allah\u2019s mercy and grace that he gives double reward to those exalting his Prophet\u2019s mention. In this hadith, the Prophet \ufdfa clarifies that if a person exalts the Prophet\u2019s mentions one time, Allah will similarly have mercy, reward, honor, and exalt his mention in the highest assembly ten times. It is said that the meaning is that Allah approaches his servants with compassion and brings them out of darkness into light as He says, \u201cHe it is Who sends \u1e62al\u0101t (His blessings) on you, and His angels too (ask Allah to bless and forgive you), that He may bring you out from darkness into light.\u201d (Al-Ahzab: 43) This is like Allah\u2019s saying in the sacred hadith in Bukhari, \u201cI am as my slave expects me to be, and I am with him when he remembers Me. If he remembers Me inwardly, I will remember him inwardly, and if he remembers Me in an assembly, I will remember him in a better assembly.\u201d Thus, a Muslim\u2019s exalting the Prophet\u2019s mentions is better than supplicating for himself. In Sunan An-Nasa\u2019i, Anas ibn Malek narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa says, \u201cWhoever exalts my mention one time, Allah will exalt his mention ten times, forgive ten sins, and raise him ten degrees.\u201d Finally, this hadith urges to frequently exalt the Prophet\u2019s mention.."}, {"number": 166, "hadith": "Jaber narrated, \"The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa was ill so we prayed behind him while he was sitting and Abu Bakr was conveying his takbir to people. When he turned and saw us standing, he gestured for us to sit down so we prayed sitting behind him. After uttering salutation, he said, 'You just like did what Persians and Romans did. They used to stand before their sitting kings. Do not do it but follow your prayer leaders. If they pray standing, then pray standing and if they pray sitting, then pray sitting.'\".", "commentary": "The Prophet \ufdfa taught us the rules and etiquette of congregational prayer, including following and listening to the prayer leader's recitation while maintaining humility and regular rows. In this hadith, Jabir ibn Abdullah related that when the Prophet \ufdfa was ill, he led them in prayer while sitting. At the same time, Abu Bakr was conveying his takbir (saying, 'Allahu Akbar) to people so they could follow his moves in prayer, due to the Prophet's weak voice during illness. While praying, he noticed that they were praying standing behind him. He gestured for them to sit and they did. After finishing, he showed them that it was the Persians and Romans' habit with their kings. They used to stand before their sitting kings. His statement indicated that it was similar to the acts of the polytheists and the People of the Book. The Prophet \ufdfa prohibited them from doing so and instead guided them to follow their imam's case whether they were praying standing or sitting. This hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It confirms the necessity of acting, unlike the non-Muslims' acts in all cases, (2) The Prophet \ufdfa experienced what other people did such as illnesses, the issue that did not decrease his status. On the contrary, this increased his dignity and status, and (3) The imam can pray sitting when being unable to stand, and the people should follow his case and pray behind him while sitting as well.."}, {"number": 167, "hadith": "Anas narrated, \u201cThe Messenger of Allah \ufdfa one day led us in prayer. Upon completing the prayer, he turned his face towards us and said, \u2018O People, I am your prayer leader, so neither precede me in bowing and prostration nor in standing and leaving, for I see you in front and behind me.\u2019 Then, he said, \u2018By Him in Whose hand is the life of Muhammad, if you had seen what I saw, you would have laughed little and wept much.\u2019 They said, \u2018What did you see, O Messenger of Allah \ufdfa?\u2019 He replied, \u2018I saw Paradise and Hell.\u2019\u201d.", "commentary": "The Prophet \ufdfa commanded Muslims to follow the prayer leader (imam) in all of his moves and prohibited them from preceding him. In this hadith, Anas ibn Malek narrated that one day the Prophet \ufdfa guided them - after ending the congregational prayer - to avoid preceding him in bowing and prostration nor standing and leaving and showed that he saw them in front and behind him. He may have meant that Allah granted him this exceptional privilege or that Allah revealed to him their moves in prayer, for vision may have expressed knowledge. Then, he swore by Allah that if his companions had seen what I saw, they would have laughed little and wept much for the horrible matters Allah revealed to him. When they asked him about the reason, he answered them that he had seen Paradise and Hell. He wanted to tell them that if they had seen what he saw of Paradise\u2019s bliss for the obedient ones and Hell\u2019s torment for the disobedient ones, they would have been overwhelmed by worry and distress, for they would have hoped to get Paradise\u2019s bliss and avoid Hell\u2019s torment. They would have laughed a little and wept much, for none could know his fate. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It encourages Muslims to be submissive in prayer and complete its pillars, (2) The imam should teach people the conditions of prayer, especially if he sees something contradicts them, and (3) It clarifies the Prophet\u2019s miracle that he can see in front and behind him alike.."}, {"number": 168, "hadith": "Abu Huraira narrated that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \"People should avoid raising their gaze to the sky while supplicating in prayer. Otherwise, their sight will be taken away.\".", "commentary": "Prayer can be only learned from the Islamic texts whether it is obligatory or supererogatory. All Muslims have to perfectly perform its aspects, including humility, looking at the place of prostration, and avoiding turning around. In this hadith, the Prophet (\ufdfa) says, \"People should avoid raising their gaze to the sky while supplicating in prayer...\" This is an explicit prohibition of raising one's gaze to the sky when supplicating in prayer. It is the same if one does that at the beginning of a prayer or after standing up from bowing, for it means turning away from the prayer direction, neglecting the form of prayer, and having bad etiquette with Allah. All of these attributes contradict tranquility and humility in prayer. If one's heart is modest, his limbs will be tranquil. His saying, \"Otherwise, their sight will be taken away,\" is the terrible result that Allah will suddenly and quickly take their sight. Finally, this hadith has the following benefits: (1) It is forbidden to intentionally raise one's gaze to the sky while supplicating in prayer, and (2) One of advice's etiquette in public is to not mean or direct it to a specific person, for this definitely will lead to be refused due to provocation.."}, {"number": 169, "hadith": "Jaber ibn Samura narrated, \u201cThe Messenger of Allah \ufdfa came to us and said, \u2018Why I see you lifting your hands like the tails of headstrong horses? Be calm in prayer.\u2019 He again came and saw us (sitting) in circles so he said, \u2018Why I see you (setting) in separate groups?\u2019 The, he again came to us and said, \u2018Why do not you pray in rows as the angels stand in the presence of their God?\u2019 We said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, how do the angels stand in rows in the presence of their God?\u2019 He answered, \u2018They complete the first rows and keep close together in the row.\u2019\u201d.", "commentary": "The Prophet \ufdfa was the best teacher and educator for his companions. He used to observe their situations and guided them to what was best for them. In this hadith, Jaber narrated that one day the Prophet \ufdfa observed that his companions were raising their hands when ending the prayer, so he prohibited them from lifting their hands like the tails of headstrong horses in prayer, for the horses sometimes move their tails and legs out of unrest. This is not commensurate with prayer\u2019s prestige and the praying one\u2019s solemnity, so he commanded them to be tranquil in prayer. In another narration of Imam Muslim, he said, \u201cWhen the praying one wants to end his prayer, he should only turn his face towards his companion without gesturing with his hand.\u201d He means that the praying one turns his face to his right and his left saying, \u201cMay Allah\u2019s peace and mercy be upon you\u201d without gesturing with his hand, which is prohibited. In another situation, the Prophet \ufdfa saw his companions sitting in circles, so he guided them to gather and avoid sitting in separate circles. In another situation, he taught them to pray in rows as the angels stand in Allah\u2019s presence. He showed that the angel stood in rows completing one by one. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It shows how the Prophet \ufdfa was keen to teach and guide his companions, which is the issue that Muslim scholars should follow, (2) A Muslim should be submissive in prayer without imitating animals, (3) Muslims should gather and avoid disunity in assemblies, and (4) It commands Muslims to complete and straighten prayer\u2019s rows.."}, {"number": 170, "hadith": "Abdullah ibn Masoud said, \"The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, 'Let people of understanding and reason be near to me in prayer, then those after them (thrice) and beware of the commotion of markets.\u201d.", "commentary": "Congregational prayer in mosques is of great importance and great reward. Thus, Islamic law cares about regulating its rows behind the imam so that people can feel psychological and physical discipline. In this hadith, the Prophet (\ufdfa) commanded people of understanding and reason to directly stand behind him in prayer for the following reasons: (1) They have the priority to pray behind him, (2) They are the best people to convey his acts of prayer to others, (3) Their ability to remind him of something he may forget regarding Quranic verses or prayer moves, or (4) They are the best people to represent him if something happens to him during prayer. The rest of the people pray next to and behind this type of people. Then, women pray behind men's rows. As for the imams (leaders in prayer), this is the order: (1) Those who are best in the Quran memorization and have more knowledge, (2) Those who are best in Quran memorization, know the prayer's rules, and the adults, (3) Those who are less in knowledge. This does not mean confining the front rows to them, but this Prophetic command is to urge them to hasten to perform congregation prayer, directly learn how he prays, and convey his guidance to those behind them. Then, the Prophet (\ufdfa) warned, \"Beware of the commotion of markets.\u201d He meant loud voices, noise, disputes, and trials in markets. As a result, we have to avoid these behaviors in prayers and mosques, as happens in markets.."}, {"number": 171, "hadith": "Anas said, \"The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa saying, 'Complete the rows, for I can see you behind my back.'\".", "commentary": "Submissiveness is the spirit of prayer, through which a Muslim gets tranquility in prayer to be closer to Allah, the Almighty. The Prophet (\ufdfa) used to teach Muslims prayer etiquette so they could perform it as it should be. In this hadith, he commanded his companions to complete prayer rows. This is done by making it even without leaving any space in between. He added, \"..., for I can see you behind my back.\" His seeing them from behind is either: (1) A miracle that Allah granted to him which was one of his characteristics, which neither a reason nor legislation may negate. As a result, a Muslim should believe in it, or (2) Due to Allah's revelation to him of his companions\u2019 actions during prayer. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) It urges Muslims to stick to submissiveness and complete the prayer pillars, (2) The prayer leader has to alert and correct people\u2019s mistakes in prayer, and (3) It shows the Prophetic miracle that he can see his companions from behind.."}, {"number": 172, "hadith": "Abu Saeed Al-Khudry narrated that when the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa perceived a tendency among his companions to go to the back (in lines of prayer).

This hadith clarified that he perceived that some of his companions were not keen to early go to the mosque or some did not care for completing lines to the extent that some prayed in rear lines. As a result, he said to them, \"Come forward and follow me in prayer. Let those coming after you follow you in prayer.\" This is because those praying behind the first line may not see how he is praying. Afterward, he warned, \"People will continue to keep back till Allah will put them at the back.\" He may mean that people continue praying in the rear lines until Allah keeps them back in the rear ranks of Paradise, or they continue leaving the first line in prayer until Allah deprives them of his great bounties. Finally, this hadith reminds that continuous negligence in acts of worship leads to staying away from Allah and getting His wrath.."}, {"number": 173, "hadith": "Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \"The best of the men's rows (in prayer) is the first row and the worst is the last.

Whoever performs righteous deeds based on their rules is better than whoever performs them without adhering to those rules although he can stick to them. This hadith clarifies that women have their special rules during attending prayers in mosques. These rules as staying away from men and cases of suspicion. The Prophet \ufdfa shows that the best of the men's rows in prayer are the first rows behind the prayer leader (imam), for they are the farthest rows from the women. He adds, \u201cThe worst is the last,\u201d for they do not hasten to the acts of worship and are close to women\u2019s rows. On the contrary, Allah commands women to wear veils and stay away from men. As a result, the Prophet \ufdfa confirms that the best of the women's rows are the last ones, for they are far from men\u2019s rows and temptation. He adds, \u201cAnd the worst is the first,\u201d for they are close to men\u2019s rows and temptation. This rule is applied when both genders attend the prayer in the mosque, but if it is a prayer that is only attended by women, the original rule of the virtue of the first rows is applied as in the case of men. The Prophetic word, \u201cthe worst\u201d means the least rewarded and virtuous and the farthest from the Islamic rules. His word, \u201cthe best\u201d means the opposite of the above-mentioned meaning. Finally, this hadith contains the following benefits: (1) The perfection of the acts of worship is linked to performing them based on the Islamic rules, (2) Islam urges men to hasten to the acts of worship and the first virtuous rows in prayers, (3) Islam urges women to pray in the rare virtuous rows away from men, (4) It explains the order of prayer rows in terms of virtue and reward, (5) It clarifies how Islam is keen to urge people to stay away from cases of temptation. It commands women to stay away from men to avoid any possibility of committing forbidden acts, (6) It shows the superiority of men over women, for they have priority in important matters like rows of prayer, fighting, etc.."}, {"number": 174, "hadith": "Zainab Ath-Thaqafeyya used to narrate that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \"If any one of you (women) wants to attend Isha prayer, she should not perfume herself that night.\".", "commentary": "Islam established ground rules on women's going out to attend congregational prayers in mosques. These rules related to clothes, manners, decency, adornment, and staying away from places of suspicion. Performing righteous acts while sticking to Islamic rules is better than doing these acts while neglecting those rules in spite of one's ability to abide by them. In this hadith, the Prophet (\ufdfa) instructed Muslim women to abide by Islamic rules when they wanted to attend Isha (evening) prayer in the mosque. He confirmed that a woman was allowed to take care of her cleanliness, but not allowed to wear perfume before going out to prayer. Wearing perfume is a means to evoke men's whims and draw their attention. This prohibition is applied to all prayers and the Prophet (\ufdfa) may have referred to Isha prayer for the following reasons: (1) Women may be subject to harassment at night more, or (2) Women used to put on perfume for their husbands at night. Muslim scholars mentioned some similar cases that may go under this prohibition such as: (1) Adorned clothes, (2) Wearing jewelry, and (3) All means that may arouse men\u2019s whims. Thus, Islamic law placed restrictions that guarantee the safety and security of both women and societies while preserving her right to go to mosques to pray.

As for the noon prayer, he stood in the first two rak'as as if he recited Surat As-Sajda (thirty verses) and stood half of that time in the last two ones, i.e. fifteen verses. As for the afternoon prayer, they estimated that he stood in the first two rak'as as he did in the last two rak'as of the noon prayer (fifteen verses) and stood half of that time in the last two ones (seven or eight verses). Some scholars conclude that the wisdom in lengthening the noon prayer is that it is the time to take a nap, so it is suitable to lengthen it to enable people to get it. Finally, this hadith recommends lengthening the first and second rak'as and shortening the third and fourth ones in both noon and afternoon prayers.."}, {"number": 178, "hadith": "Qaz\u2019a ibn Yahya narrated, \u201cI came to Abu Saeed Al-Khudry while he was surrounded by people. When the people left him, I said, \u2018I do not want to ask you what these people asked you. I want to ask you about the prayer of the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa.\u2019 Abu Saeed said, \u2018There is no good for you in this.\u2019\u201d Qaz'a repeated his question. Abu Saeed said, \u201cWhen the noon prayer started, one of us went to Baqi' to relieve himself, came to his home to perform ablution, and then went to the mosque to find the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa in the first rak'a.\u201d.", "commentary": "The companions\u2019 students were keen to know everything about the Prophet \ufdfa from his companions so they used to ask them about his deeds, especially his prayer. In this hadith, Qaza\u2019a ibn Yahya narrated that he came to Abu Saeed Al-Khudry while the latter was being surrounded by people. When they left him, Qaza\u2019a told him that he wanted to ask him about the Prophet\u2019s prayer. Abu Saeed told him that knowing his prayer would benefit him none due to its length and perfection, for it would be difficult for him to imitate the Prophet\u2019s prayer. Qaza\u2019a repeated his request so Abu Saeed told him that when the Prophet \ufdfa began the noon prayer, a person could go to Baqi' - cemeteries in Medina to the east of the Prophet\u2019s Mosque where people used to relieve themselves in nearby places -, came to his home to perform ablution, and found the Prophet \ufdfa in the first rak'a. This indicated the Prophet \ufdfa used to lengthen the first rak\u2019a of the noon prayer. One may say that there are some hadiths that the Prophet \ufdfa used to shorten his prayer. To answer this opinion, it should be clarified that the Prophet \ufdfa lengthened and shortened his prayers according to the people\u2019s circumstances behind him. He sometimes wanted to lengthen the prayer then decided to shorten it after having a reasonable issue such as hearing a kid\u2019s crying during the congregational prayer. Some scholars said that he sometimes lengthened it, which is the least, to clarify the permissibility, and sometimes shortened it, which is the most, to confirm its privilege.."}, {"number": 179, "hadith": "Abd Allah ibn As-Sa'eb narrated, \"The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa led us in Fajr (Dawn) prayer at Mecca. He began to recite Surat Al-Mu'minun. When he recited the verses about Prophets Moses and Aaron - or Prophet Jesus -, the prophet started to cough then bowed and Abd Allah ibn As-Sa'eb was present.\" In another narration, \"He cut (his recitation) then bowed.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet's Companions used to closely observe his deeds to follow and convey his guidance to people, especially regarding the acts of worship. In this hadith, Abdullah ibn As-Sa'eb narrated that the Prophet (\ufdfa) led his companions in Fajr (Dawn) prayer in the eighth year after Hijra (the year of conquering Mecca). He was reciting Surat Al-Mu\u2019minoun until he recited the verse (no. 45) that mentioned Prophets Musa and Haroun in which Allah said, \"Then, We sent Musa (Moses) and his brother Haroun (Aaron), with Our proofs and manifest authority,\" or the verse (no. 50) that mentioned Prophet Jesus in which Allah says, \"And We made the son of Maryam (Mary) and his mother as a sign, and We gave them refuge on high ground, a place of rest, security and flowing streams.\" This doubt is from Muhammad ibn Abbad or others of this hadith narrators. At that time, the Prophet (\ufdfa) was coughing and then bowed without completing the surah. In another narration, the Prophet (\ufdfa) \"stopped reciting then bowed.\" Finally, this hadith confirms that a Muslim would bow without completing his recitation in prayer if something happened to him while reciting the Quran.."}, {"number": 180, "hadith": "Amr ibn Huraith narrated that he heard the Prophet \ufdfa reciting at Fajr (Dawn) prayer, \u201cAnd by the night as it closes in.\" (At-Takwir: 17).", "commentary": "The Prophet's companions used to observe and learn from all of his acts to follow his guidance, especially in the acts of worship. They also used to transmit all of his details to all people. In this hadith, Amr ibn Huraith said that the Prophet once recited short Quranic suras in Fajr prayer (Dawn prayer). Amr reported that he heard the Prophet (\ufdfa) recite Surah At-Takwir during Fajr prayer. It is the sura that contains this verse, \u201cAnd by the night as it closes in.\u201d (Al-Takwir: 17) This was explained by An-Nasa\u2019i\u2019s narration in which Amr reported, \u201cI heard the Prophet (\ufdfa) recite in Fajr prayer, \"When the sun is wrapped up [in darkness].\" All of the hadiths that clarified the Prophet's recitation in Fajr prayer showed that he may have recited long, short, or medium suras.."}, {"number": 181, "hadith": "\u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n ibn Abi \u2018Amrah reported: \u2018Uthm\u0101n ibn \u2018Aff\u0101n entered the mosque after the Maghrib prayer and sat alone. I sat in front of him, and he said: \"O son of my brother, I heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say: Whoever performs the \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayer in congregation, it is as if he has prayed for half the night, and whoever performs the Fajr prayer in congregation, it is as if he has prayed for the whole night.'\".", "commentary": "Allah Almighty multiplied the reward for the congregation prayer until it surpassed the prayer offered individually by twenty-seven degrees, and its merit increases if it is offered during the night, given its closeness to sincerity to Allah Almighty. Indeed, it is one of the greatest acts aimed at getting close to Allah.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i (the generation after the Companions) \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n ibn Abi \u2018Amrah relates that \u2018Uthm\u0101n ibn \u2018Aff\u0101n (may Allah be pleased with him) entered the mosque after the Maghrib prayer and sat alone waiting for the time of \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayer to come so that he would offer it in congregation. \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n said: \"I sat in front of him.\" It is as if he sat to learn from him and ask him about the reason for his sitting and waiting. So, \u2018Uthm\u0101n (may Allah be pleased with him) said to him: \"O son of my brother.\" He meant the brotherhood of Islam, not that of blood. \"I heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say: Whoever performs the \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayer in congregation, it is as if he has prayed for half the night.\" In other words, he will obtain a reward like one who engages in worship from the early part of the night to its middle and spends this time in prayer and dhikr (remembrance of Allah). \"And whoever performs the Fajr prayer in congregation, it is as if he has prayed for the whole night.\" He will obtain a reward like one who engages in worship all night long and spends this time in prayer and dhikr. So, the reward for offering the Fajr prayer in congregation is double the reward for offering the \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayer in congregation, which indicates that getting up for the Fajr prayer is more meritorious than getting up for the \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayer. This is because the Fajr prayer is harder and more difficult for the performer and more tough for the devil. Indeed, he who goes to sleep and then gets up finds it harder than one who wants to sleep. Or it means that each of them equals half of the night, and together they amount to one night. So, whoever offers the \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 and Fajr prayers in congregation, it is as if he has prayed for all the night, as related in a version by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd and At-Tirmidhi: \"Whoever attends the \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayer in congregation obtains the reward of praying for half the night, and whoever offers the \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 and Fajr prayers in congregation obtains the reward of praying for one night.\" In any case, this urges and encourages the regular observance of the Fajr and \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayers in congregation. This particular merit afforded to them may be because of the hardship involved in attending the mosques to pray them, like the darkness and the fact that in those times people usually take rest, most likely sleep, or spend private time with their families.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that some prayers are characterized by a certain merit not shared with other prayers.."}, {"number": 182, "hadith": "Jundub ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Whoever performs the Fajr prayer is under the protection of Allah; so, let Allah not call you to account regarding anything of His protection; and so, He will seize him and throw him upon his face in Hellfire.\".", "commentary": "One of the best signs of faith is the strict observance of the obligatory prayers. Allah Almighty affords great merit to those who persistently observe these prayers.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) says that whoever performs the Fajr prayer in congregation - as reported in the version by Abu Nu\u2018aym in Al-Mustakhraj - \"is under the protection of Allah,\" i.e., under His safety and guarantee. He singled out the Fajr prayer from all the other prayers due to the hardship involved in its performance and because only those with sincere faith can perform it persistently; they, therefore, deserve to be under the protection, safety, and guarantee of Allah Almighty.\nThen, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"So let Allah not call you to account regarding anything of His protection, or else He will seize him and throw him upon his face in Hellfire.\" The prohibition here pertains to what entails accountability for violating Allah's guarantee and protection. The Prophet's words here have one of two possible meanings: First: Whoever performs the Fajr prayer obtains a guarantee from Allah. So, no one should harm or oppress him. Whoever oppresses or harms him, Allah will call him to account regarding His protection. Second: Do not abandon the Fajr prayer, lest the guarantee between you and your Lord will be violated, and so He will call you to account regarding it. Whoever does so, Allah will seize him and throw him upon his face in Hellfire.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Urging the performance of the Fajr prayer\nAnd in it: Demonstrating the great bounty of Allah and His vast mercy towards this Ummah, as He prescribed an immense reward for the Fajr prayer\nAnd in it: Clarifying Allah's revenge against those who harm His pious servants\nAnd in it: Demonstrating that nothing on the earth or in heaven escapes the power of Allah, and if He wants to exact revenge upon anyone, he cannot escape Him."}, {"number": 183, "hadith": "Anas reported:  The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) visited us, and there was no one other than me, my mother, and my maternal aunt \u2019Umm Har\u0101m. He said: \"Stand up so that I will lead you in prayer.\" It was not a time of prayer, he proceeded to lead us in prayer. A man said to Th\u0101bit: \"Where did he make Anas stand with him?\" He said: \"He made him stand to his right.\" Then, he supplicated for us, the members of the household, with all goodness in this world and the Hereafter. My mother said: \"O Messenger of Allah, here is your little servant; supplicate Allah for him.\" He said: He supplicated for me with all goodness, and the last of his supplication for me was: \"O Allah, increase his wealth and children and bless them for him.\".", "commentary": "One of the things urged and encouraged by Islam is to accept invitations, for this displays brotherliness and cordiality among the Muslims. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) built a good relationship with his Companions, and he used to visit them in their houses so as to teach them and supplicate for them.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Anas ibn M\u0101lik (may Allah be pleased with him) informs that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) paid a visit to them in their house, and there was none but he and his mother - \u2019Umm Sulaym - and his maternal aunt \u2019Umm Har\u0101m. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to them: \"Stand up so that I will lead you in prayer.\" This was not a time for an obligatory prayer. The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) would like the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to pray for them in their houses, in pursuit of blessing. So, he led them in a two-Rak\u2018ah voluntary prayer. Thereupon, a man asked Th\u0101bit al-Bun\u0101ni, who narrated from Anas: Where did Anas stand while he was praying with the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and on which side did he make him stand? He told him that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) made him stand on his right side, for when one person prays behind an Im\u0101m, he should stand to his right; whereas the women stand in a row behind both of them.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) supplicated for the family of Anas with all goodness in this world and the Hereafter. The mother of Anas said: \"O Messenger of Allah, here is your little servant\" i.e., your boy who serves you. She said \"your little servant\" by way of gentleness and appeasement, not belittlement. Hence, she said to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): \"supplicate Allah for him.\" She probably made this request so that his supplication for him would be compensation for him in return for his kindness to you by extending service for a long time. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) granted her request and supplicated for him with all goodness, and the last supplication he made was: \"O Allah, increase his wealth and children and bless them for him.\" Anas found the blessing of the Prophet's supplication in his wealth and children. He was the wealthiest person among the Ans\u0101r, and he saw lots of children descending from him. In a Had\u012bth narrated by Al-Bukh\u0101ri, he said: \"Indeed, I am one of the richest among the Ans\u0101r and my daughter \u2019Umaynah told me that when Al-Hajj\u0101j came to Basra, more than 120 of my offspring had been buried.\" In a version by Muslim: \"and my children and grandchildren are more than one hundred today.\"\nThe Had\u012bth contains supplication for the increase of wealth and children.\nIt comprises supplication for goodness in this world and the Hereafter, for all this lies in the Hand of Allah Almighty.\nAnd it includes preferring one's child over oneself; and making requests in a gentle manner.."}, {"number": 184, "hadith": "\u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b reported:  There was a man from the Ans\u0101r whose house was the farthest house in Mad\u012bnah, and he would not miss the prayer with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). He said: We felt bad for him, and I said to him: \"O so and so, if you buy a donkey, it will shield you from the heat of the scorching sand and shield you from the vermin of the earth.\" He said: \"By Allah, I do not like that my house be close to the house of Muhammad (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\" He said: I was troubled by that and came to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and told him. He said: He sent for him, and he said the same to him and mentioned that he hoped for a reward for his steps. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: \"You will have what you hoped for.\".", "commentary": "The Companions of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) were the most keen among people on doing good, and they would constantly look for deeds that increased their rewards with Allah Almighty.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that there was a man from the Prophet's Companions from the Ans\u0101r - the people of Mad\u012bnah - and it is mentioned in Musnad that he was the cousin of \u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b (may Allah be pleased with both of them), whose house was the farthest house from the Prophet's Mosque. Despite the remoteness of his house, he would not miss the prayer in the mosque with the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) felt pity for him for the hardship and tiredness he would go through while coming and going back. So, they said to him: If you buy a donkey, it will shield you from the heat of the scorching sand; and it will shield you from the vermin of the earth. Vermin is a term that refers to creatures with lethal poison, like serpents, and it may also refer to creatures that are not to be killed, such as insects.\nHe swore by Allah to them that he would not like his house to be adjacent to the Prophet's house; rather, he liked that it be far away from it, so that his reward would increase with the increase of steps he would take from his house to the mosque. He did not intend to negate his love for being close to the house of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) out of hatred for him, but in the hope of a greater reward with the increase of those steps. \u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b (may Allah be pleased with him) assumed by his statement that he meant hatred for the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). So, \u2019Ubayy (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"I was troubled by that\" i.e., I found that to be grave and was distressed by it, given the repugnance and horridness of what he said and its evil connotation, namely that he hated the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). In a version by Ahmed, he said: \"I have not heard a statement about him more hateful to me than it.\" \u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b (may Allah be pleased with him) interpreted his statement wrongly and thought ill of it because Mad\u012bnah abounded with hypocrites at the time, and they were keen to live away from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Then, \u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b came to the Prophet of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and informed him about what this man said. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) sent for him, and he said the same to him as he said to \u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b, and he mentioned to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) that what made him say so was that he hoped for and pursued reward and recompense from Allah for his walking. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: \"You will have what you hoped for\", i.e., Allah Almighty will give you the reward for your steps which you took for the sake of Allah, Exalted be He, and kept in store with Him. Hoping for reward means that one performs a deed for the sake of Allah and thereby seeks recompense and reward from Allah.\nThe Had\u012bth points out the merit of walking to the mosques.."}, {"number": 185, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h reported:  Our houses were situated far away from the mosque.

These are the dwellings of Banu Salamah, a group of the Ans\u0101r. They wanted to sell these dwellings, given their remoteness, and buy dwellings close to the mosque, seeking to be the neighbors of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). But, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade them from that and explained to them the reward of which they didn't know.

By contrast, markets are the places of the devil's acts of greed and heedlessness.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) mentions that the mosques are the dearest places to Allah Almighty, for they are houses of worship and dhikr and are founded on fear from Allah Almighty. In them, the Qur\u2019an is recited, knowledge is disseminated, the believers get together, the rituals of the religion are displayed, and the angels attend. Also, Allah attributed them to Himself, by way of honor and extolment, saying: {The mosques are for Allah alone.} [Surat al-Jinn: 18]\nHe also said that the markets are the most hateful places to Allah Almighty, for they witness a lot of false swearing, cheating and deception, heedlessness from the remembrance of Allah Almighty, breaking promises, and impolite treatment, as well as other similar things.

Im\u0101m here refers to the leader in prayer, as demonstrated by the last part of the Had\u012bth, as he said: \"and the most entitled among them to be the Im\u0101m is their best reciter\" who is most among them in memorizing the Qur'an and the best in understanding it. In another version by Muslim: \"The one who should lead the people in prayer is the best reciter of them in the Book of Allah.\" So, if there are a group of people qualified to lead the prayer, the best reciter of the Qur'an among them is the worthiest of being the Im\u0101m, by virtue of this merit in him. Hence, if they memorize the entire Qur'an, the one of them who recites it in the most perfect, accurate, and measured manner should be given precedence, for he is the best reciter compared to them.

The Shariah regulated this prayer and arranged the rows behind the Im\u0101m (prayer leader), so that the worshipers can be in orderliness and mental and physical discipline during the prayer.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) directs the Muslims on how to choose a prayer leader if they are a group of people, stating that the one who should lead the people in prayer is the best reciter of the Book of Allah among them. There is a difference of opinion regarding the meaning intended by \"the best reciter\". It was said: It means the best of them in recitation and the most knowledgeable about its rulings, even if he is the least among them in terms of memorization. Another view says: It means the best memorizer of the Qur\u2019an among them, for he regarded recitation as the basis for leading people in prayer and gave it precedence over all the other characteristics mentioned along with it. And another view says: It means the most knowledgeable, for if you consider the conditions of the Companions, you will find that the most knowledgeable among them is the best reciter among them. Thus, the Prophet's words, \"the best reciter of the Book of Allah among them,\" mean: the most knowledgeable among them.\nIf they are equal in terms of the acceptable level of recitation, memorization, and mastery, then it's the most knowledgeable of the Sunnah among them; that is: the one who possesses the best understanding of it and the most knowledgeable about the rulings related to the prayer and the Prophet's Sunnah concerning it. If the Im\u0101m is ignorant of the prayer's rulings and what may arise during its performance, like forgetfulness and addition or omission, he will spoil it.\nIf they are equal in all the foregoing, the earliest one to have emigrated should be given precedence. Emigration means leaving the land of disbelief to the land of Islam. Thus, the one who moves from the land of disbelief to the land of Islam earlier is worthier in leading the prayer than the one who does so later. It was said: He is given precedence either because being earlier in emigration is an honor that entails precedence, or because he who emigrates earlier is usually more knowledgeable than the one who emigrates later. It was said: The emigration associated with the precedence in prayer leadership is not intended to particularly refer to the Hijrah during the Prophet's lifetime, but it is the emigration that does not cease until the Day of Judgment, which is mentioned in a Had\u012bth narrated by An-Nas\u0101\u2019i: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Hijrah will not cease so long as the disbelievers are being fought.\" That is, it is enduring until the Day of Judgment.\nIf they are equal in terms of emigration, then the earliest one among them to have embraced Islam takes precedence. In another version, \"age\" is reported in place of \"accepting Islam\". In other words, if they are equal in all the foregoing - in knowledge, recitation, and emigration - and one of them excels the others by virtue of embracing Islam earlier or being older in age, he is given precedence because this is a merit that affords precedence.\nThen, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"No man should lead another man in prayer where the latter has authority.\" This is his place where he alone assumes authority, a place he owns, or a place where he gives judgment. So, the owner of a place is worthier. He can step forward, if he wills, or choose someone else to lead, if he wills. This is his dominion, and he can dispose as he wishes in it. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade that a man should sit in another man's house in his special place - which is reserved for him and intended to honor him, like a mat and so on - unless he is granted permission. This prohibition pertains to sitting in the special place of a man in his house. This is because the place where the head of a household sits is usually the location for certain things not liked to be seen by others, or that it overlooks his entire house or the parts he wants to see; thus, he can follow the conditions of the members of his household and tell them whatever he wants. So, if he gives permission to someone to sit in that place, this indicates that the place is free in terms of all these aspects.\nThe Had\u012bth demonstrates the order to be observed in stepping forward to lead people in prayer.\nIt also indicates that prayer leadership is one of the important things in the religion. Hence, the lawgiver enjoined that it should be undertaken by the most proficient person.\nIt also states that the head of a household is worthier than others in leading the prayer therein.\nIt also states that no one should sit in the place reserved for the head of the house without his permission.\nIt also highlights the superiority of immigrants over others.."}, {"number": 190, "hadith": "Khuf\u0101f ibn \u012am\u0101\u2019 reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) bowed in Ruk\u016b\u2018 and then raised his head and said: \"May Allah forgive Ghif\u0101r; may Allah make Aslam peaceful; \u2018Usayyah disobeyed Allah and His Messenger; O Allah, curse Banu Lihy\u0101n and curse Ri\u2018l and Dhakw\u0101n.\" Then, he fell prostrating. Khuf\u0101f said: Invoking a curse upon the disbelievers was permitted because of that..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to draw close to Allah by supplication under every condition. This includes the supplication of Qun\u016bt which he would make during the prayer.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Khuf\u0101f ibn \u012am\u0101\u2019 (may Allah be pleased with him) informs that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) bowed in Ruk\u016b\u2018 during his prayer, and when he raised his head from Ruk\u016b\u2018 in the last Rak\u2018ah - as related in the version by Ahmad - and before he went down for prostration, he stood for supplication. Part of what he said in his supplication was to supplicate for the tribe of Ghif\u0101r and the tribe of Aslam, two of the Arab tribes. He said about Ghif\u0101r: \"may Allah forgive Ghif\u0101r\". He supplicated so that Allah forgives Ghif\u0101r for their heinous acts during J\u0101hiliyyah. About Aslam, he said: \"may Allah make Aslam peaceful\". He supplicated so that Allah Almighty makes peace with Aslam and does not command war be waged against them. This may also be information that Allah Almighty forgave the tribe of Ghif\u0101r and made peace with Aslam and prevented war against them.\nAbout the tribe of \u2018Usayyah, he said that they \"disobeyed Allah and His Messenger\", as they entered a treaty with the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). This gives the sense of complaining about them and it entails supplication against them to be disgraced for their disobedience, not supplication for them to disobey.\nThen, he supplicated against some neighborhoods in the tribe of Banu Sulaym, saying: \"O Allah, curse Banu Lihy\u0101n and curse Ri\u2018l and Dhakw\u0101n.\" This is because they disobeyed Allah Almighty and His Messenger (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and acted treacherously towards his noble Companions, killing the reciters whom the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) sent to them to teach them their religion. Then, when he finished his supplication, he fell prostrating.\nThereafter, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) stopped supplicating against them when Allah Almighty revealed the verse that reads: {It is not for you [O Prophet] to decide} [Surat \u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n: 128] as related in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections. This noble verse was a sign to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) that Allah Almighty might guide those people to Islam.\nIt was not the habit of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to supplicate against the polytheists in every situation. Rather, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was most merciful and compassionate towards them. But, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would sometimes supplicate against them when their violence and harm increased and grew and at other times he would supplicate for them when no trouble was feared from them and it was hoped they could win their hearts and embrace Islam.\nKhuf\u0101f (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"Invoking curse upon the disbelievers was permitted because of that,\" i.e., supplication against the disbelievers was adopted and became legitimate because of this act by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his invocation of a curse upon those disbelieving tribes. So, if they attack the Muslims, they should be supplicated against, in line with the Prophet's example.\nThe Had\u012bth demonstrates a merit and good characteristic for both Aslam and Ghif\u0101r.."}, {"number": 191, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported:  We stopped for rest along with the Prophet of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and did not awake till the sun rose. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Each man should take hold of his mount's head, for this is a place where the devil has visited us.\" He said: We did accordingly. Then, he asked for water and performed ablution and then offered two prostrations - [In a version] Then, he prayed two prostrations - Then, the Iq\u0101mah for prayer was pronounced and he performed the morning prayer..", "commentary": "Prayer is the greatest among the practical pillars of Islam, and it enjoys particular significance in the Shariah. Allah Almighty appointed specific times for its performance, and whoever misses the appointed time should make up for the missed prayer and not leave it.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that they were on a journey with the Prophet of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and they stopped at a place in the latter part of the night for rest and sleep and did not wake up till the rise of the sun, whose heat awakened them; as in a Had\u012bth reported by \u2018Imr\u0101n ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) and narrated by Al-Bukh\u0101ri and Muslim. Consequently, they missed the Fajr prayer. When the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) woke up, he said to his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them): \"Each man should take hold of his mount's head\" i.e., hold the bridle of his mount and get out of this place; \"for this is a place where the devil has visited us.\" And he caused them to be heedless of the time of prayer in this place, and it is as if he was still around them with this heedlessness. So, by their departure from this place, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) wanted to turn away from the devil. They complied with the Prophet's command and got out of their place, and then they proceeded on the way for a while. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked for water, performed ablution, \"and then offered two prostrations\". And in a version: \"Then, he prayed two prostrations\" i.e., he performed two Rak\u2018ahs, in return for the Sunnah of the Fajr prayer. Then, the Iq\u0101mah was pronounced for the obligatory prayer. \"and he performed the morning prayer\", which is the Fajr prayer.\nThe Had\u012bth mentions making up for the regular supererogatory prayer.\nIt indicates that the Fajr prayer is also known as the morning prayer.\nIt also urges avoidance of the places where the devil is present.."}, {"number": 192, "hadith": "Abu Qat\u0101dah reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) addressed us and said: \"You will proceed with your journey in the evening and night. Then, you will come to a place of water, Allah Willing, tomorrow.\" So, the people proceeded without paying any heed to one another. Abu Qat\u0101dah said: \"As the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) traveled until it was midnight, and I was by his side, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) dozed off and leaned (to one side) of his camel. I went to him and lent him support without waking him up until he sat upright on his riding mount. He went on traveling until a major part of the night was over and he leaned (to one side) of his camel. I supported him without waking him up until he sat upright on his mount. Then, he traveled until it was near dawn. Then, he leaned, but far more than the two earlier leanings, and he was about to fall. So, I went to him and supported him, and he lifted his head and said: 'Who is this?' I said: 'It is Abu Q\u0101tadah.' He said: 'How long have you been traveling along with me like this?' I said: 'I have been traveling in this very state since the night.' He said: 'May Allah guard you as you have guarded His Prophet.' Then, he said: 'Do you see that we are out of the sight of the people?' Then, he said: 'Do you see anyone?' I said: 'Here is a rider.' I again said: 'Here is another rider, until we gathered together, and we were seven riders.' The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) stepped aside off the road and placed his head and then said: 'Guard our prayers for us.' The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was the first to wake up, and the rays of the sun were falling on his back. We got up startled. He said: 'Ride on.' So, we rode on until the sun had risen. He then dismounted and called for a jug of water which I had with me. There was a little water in it. He performed ablution which was less thorough than his usual ablutions, and some water was left. Then, he said to Abu Qat\u0101dah: 'Keep for us your jug of water; it will have a word.' Thereafter, Bil\u0101l made the Adh\u0101n (call for prayer), and then the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) observed two Rak\u2018ahs and then observed the Fajr prayer as he did every day. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) rode on and we rode along with him, and some of us whispered to the others saying: 'What is the expiation for the negligence we committed in our prayers?' Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: 'Is there not in me a role model for you? There is no negligence in sleeping. Negligence is not observing the prayer until the time of the next prayer comes. So, whoever does this should observe the prayer when he becomes aware of it, and on the next day, he should observe the prayer at its prescribed time.' Then, he said: 'What do you think the people would do (at this hour) when they would not find their Prophet with them in the morning. Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar said: \u2018The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) is behind you, and he does not leave you behind.\u2019 Other people said: \u2018The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) is ahead of you.\u2019 So, if they obey Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar, they will follow the right path.' We proceeded on until we came up to the people (from whom we had lagged behind), and the sun had considerably risen, and everything became hot, and they said: 'O Messenger of Allah, we are dying, we are thirsty.' Whereupon, he said: 'You will not die (of thirst).' And he then said: 'Bring that small cup of mine.' Then, he asked for the jug of water to be brought to him. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) poured water, and Abu Qat\u0101dah gave them water to drink. When the people saw that there was water in the jug, they gathered in crowds around it. Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: 'Behave well in your gathering; you will drink to your fill.' They complied. So, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would fill (the cup), and I would serve them until no one was left except me and the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). He then filled (the cup) with water and said to me: 'Drink it.' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I will not drink until you drink.' He said: 'The server of the people is the last among them to drink.' So, I drank, and the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) also drank, and the people came to the place of water quite happy and satiated.\" \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn Rab\u0101h said: \"As I was narrating this Had\u012bth in the grand mosque, \u2018Imr\u0101n ibn Husayn said: 'Consider, O young man, how you narrate, for I was one of the riders in that night.' I said: 'So, you must know this Had\u012bth well.' He said: 'Who are you?' I said: 'I am one of the Ans\u0101r.' Thereupon, he said: 'You narrate, for you know your Had\u012bths better.' I, therefore, narrated it to the people. Then, \u2018Imr\u0101n said: 'I was also present that night, but I do not know anyone who memorized it the way I memorized it.'\".", "commentary": "Prayer is the greatest among the practical pillars of Islam, and it enjoys particular significance in Shariah. Allah Almighty appointed specific times for its performance, and whoever misses the appointed time should make up for the missed prayer and not leave it.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Abu Qat\u0101dah al-Ans\u0101ri (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) addressed the army which he led, saying: \"You will proceed with your journey in the evening.\" This extends from midday to sunset, the latter part of the daytime, (and night), which means: You will go out on the path of your journey in the evening and proceed with your journey throughout the night. \"Then, you will come to a place of water, Allah Willing, tomorrow,\" i.e., they would reach the water in the morning. His words, Allah Willing, point to the Prophet's compliance with this command of Allah Almighty: {And never say about anything: \"I will surely do this tomorrow,\" without adding: \"if Allah wills.\"} [Surat al-Kahf: 23-24] So, he would say \"Allah Willing\" in any future matter. When the people heard his words, they proceeded fast with their travel without paying any heed to one another. In other words, they did not pay attention or turn toward one another. Rather, each person was walking alone and not paying heed to the company, caring for himself in pursuing and reaching the water. \"The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) traveled until it was midnight,\" i.e., it was the middle of the night and darkness accumulated; or a major part of the night did pass and one-third of it was remaining. Abu Qat\u0101dah (may Allah be pleased with him) was by his side. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) started dozing off \n - the beginning of sleep - as he moved. He began to lean and almost fell off his mount. Meanwhile, Abu Qat\u0101dah (may Allah be pleased with him) would support him to help him sit upright and not fall. He did all that without awakening the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did that a number of times, and this happened when a major part of the night was over. Abu Qat\u0101dah (may Allah be pleased with him) kept supporting him so that he would not fall off his riding animal.\" The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went on traveling, and when it was near dawn, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) leaned so heavily that he almost fell. So, Abu Qat\u0101dah (may Allah be pleased with him) came to him and lent him support, like a bolster under him. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) got up from his sleep, raised his head, and asked: Who is this one who is helping me? Abu Qat\u0101dah replied that it was him. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked him: Since when? Abu Qat\u0101dah (may Allah be pleased with him) replied that he kept guarding and supporting him from the first time he slept during that night. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) supplicated that may Allah guard him as he guarded His Messenger. Then, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked him: \"Do you see that we are out of the sight of the people?\" In other words, have we delayed and lagged behind them? This is because the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), due to his drowsiness, was not aware of how much he lagged behind the army. This also indicates that no one was with him except Abu Qat\u0101dah. It was the Prophet's habit to travel at the rear of the army to show leniency towards the army, carry the weak, and prod those who lag behind. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked him: \"Do you see anyone?\" Based on that, he wanted to determine whether to move faster with his mount or at the same pace. Abu Qat\u0101dah (may Allah be pleased with him) replied: Here is a rider, and here is another rider. This means that they were catching up with the army personnel, one after another. They gathered together until they became seven in number. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) turned away from the road - lest they may be harmed by any vermin moving therein - and headed, along with those with him, for sleep, and he placed his head. The version narrated by Al-Bukh\u0101ri pointed out that the Prophet's (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) stepping aside was at the request of some of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to them: \"I fear you may oversleep and fail to perform the prayer.\" Bil\u0101l said: \"I will wake you all up. So, lie down.\"\nThen, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Guard our prayers for us,\" i.e., its time. This refers to the Fajr prayer. Do not fail to perform it due to sleep. They felt sleepy and lay down. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) fell into a deep sleep, and they did not wake up for the Fajr prayer. \"The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was the first to wake up, while the rays of the sun were falling on his back.\" This indirectly indicates that it was the heat of the sun that awakened him. Abu Qat\u0101dah said: \"We got up startled.\" They were startled because they missed the Fajr prayer due to sleep. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ordered them to ride their mounts before making up for the Fajr prayer. He mentioned in a version narrated by Muslim and reported by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the reason behind their departure from the place before praying is that he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"This is a place where the devil visited us.\" They proceeded until they went out of that place and kept moving until the sun had risen. In another version narrated by Muslim and reported by \u2018Imr\u0101n ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him): \"until the sun shone brightly\", i.e., it went high, and its yellowness or redness disappeared. The intended meaning: The extent to which the sun goes high with which prayer after sunrise ceases to be disliked. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) dismounted and called for a jug of water, which was with Abu Qat\u0101dah and contained a little water. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used its water for performing ablution which was less thorough than his usual ablutions, i.e., a moderate ablution, given the shortage of water. He did not perform ablution thoroughly as usual. Or that he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) adopted the one-time approach in its performance and did not pour a lot of water, for he wanted to keep some of it so that his blessing and his miraculous act would appear therein. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to Abu Qat\u0101dah: \"Keep for us your jug of water\" and the water it contains. \"It will have a word.\" i.e., momentous news or a miracle in the future - the blessing that would come to the people.\nThen, Bil\u0101l (may Allah be pleased with him) made the Adh\u0101n for the missed prayer. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) first performed the two-Rak\u2018ah Sunnah of the Fajr prayer and then the obligatory Fajr prayer as a missed prayer. His prayer was the same as the prayers he would perform every day at their appointed times, with no difference between his performance of prayer at the appointed time and his performance of it as a missed prayer. After the prayer was over, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) rode his mount, and so did the people, and they went out traveling on their way. But they began to whisper to one another in a low voice, saying: \"What is the expiation for our negligence towards our prayers?\" They feared the sin and the penalty for that. When the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) heard their words, seeking to comfort them amid their grief over missing the Fajr prayer, he said: \"Is there not in me a role model for you?\" In other words, an example to imitate and follow. This seems to indicate that he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) wanted them to understand that their performance of the prayer as a missed prayer is an expiation for missing it. Then, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"There is no negligence in sleeping,\" and no neglect in missing the prayer because a sleeping person has no choice. Rather, neglect and sin are upon a wakeful person who fails to perform a prayer - intentionally and out of neglect and lethargy - until the time of the next prayer comes. \"So, whoever does this\" - i.e., he oversleeps and fails to perform a prayer until its time elapses - \"should observe the prayer when he becomes aware of it\" - i.e., after he wakes up - \"and in the next day, he should observe the prayer at its prescribed time.\" In other words, he should not delay the prayer beyond its usual time. This does not mean that he should perform the missed prayer twice, one time at that moment and another time the next day.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked those present with him: \"'What do you think the people have done?\" He meant the front part of the army and those who went ahead of them. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was inquiring about their condition since the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) unusually lagged behind them. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) answered his question and informed those with him that Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with both of them) are saying to the people: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) is behind you;\" i.e., he is after you and lagging behind you and has not come yet, for he would not \"leave you behind, i.e., he would not go ahead of you and leave you behind. They meant to ask the people to wait for the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) until he could catch up with them. Some others said: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went ahead of us. Thus, they were asking the people to proceed. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"So, if they obey Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar, they will follow the right path\" because they are right and correct, as the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was in the state Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with both of them) talked about.\nThereafter, Abu Qat\u0101dah informed that they reached the front of the army in which Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with both of them) were, as \"the sun had considerably risen\" - i.e., the sun went high - \"and everything became hot;\" i.e., the heat became severe. Everyone was suffering from exhaustion and hardship, saying: \"O Messenger of Allah, we are dying\" - i.e., from the hot weather - \"and thirsty\" due to the lack of water. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) reassured them that they will not die. Then, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Bring that small cup of mine,\" i.e., untie my luggage, take my small cup out of it, and bring it to me. And he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked for the jug of water which was with Abu Qat\u0101dah (may Allah be pleased with him). The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) began to pour water into the jug, while Abu Qat\u0101dah (may Allah be pleased with him) was giving them water to drink. When the people saw that a lot of water was coming out of the jug, they gathered in crowds around it to drink and store water from it. Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Behave well;\" that is, be good in manners and dealing with one another as you drink. He gave them good news that they would all quench their thirst and drink from that water. So, do not act badly by jostling and pushing. They complied with the Prophet's command. So, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) continued to pour water and Abu Qat\u0101dah (may Allah be pleased with him) was giving them the water to drink. This continued until none remained but Abu Qat\u0101dah and the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) poured water and said to Abu Qat\u0101dah: 'Drink.' Out of politeness, Abu Qat\u0101dah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"O Messenger of Allah, I will not drink until you drink.\" So, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"The one who serves water to people is the last of them to drink.\" So, Abu Qat\u0101dah drank, and the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was the last to drink among the people. This is one of the etiquettes to be observed in drinking water. After that, the people reached the place of water which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) told them about when he addressed them on the first day - \"quite happy\", i.e., restful and in good condition, and \"satiated\", i.e., having drunk water to their fill.\nThe T\u0101bi\u2018i \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn Rab\u0101h mentioned that he was narrating this Had\u012bth in the grand mosque, i.e. in Basra. So, \u2018Imr\u0101n ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) said to him: \"Consider, O young man, how you narrate;\" i.e., what Had\u012bth you are narrating; or about what condition you are narrating, \"for I was one of the riders in that night.\" In other words, pay attention, O young man, and narrate in an accurate way, for I am one of those who witnessed this incident, and I will check what you narrate against what I witnessed. He replied to him: \"So, you must know this Had\u012bth better,\" since you were one of the riders and witnessed this incident. \u2018Imr\u0101n ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) said to him: \"Who are you?\" He replied: \"I am one of the Ans\u0101r,\" the dwellers of Mad\u012bnah. Thereupon, \u2018Imr\u0101n (may Allah be pleased with him) asked him to narrate, as he praised the Ans\u0101r, saying: \"You know your Had\u012bths better.\" When \u2018Abdull\u0101h narrated the Had\u012bth and finished its narration and it was consistent with \u2018Imr\u0101n's account, \u2018Imr\u0101n (may Allah be pleased with him) said to him: \"I was present that night, but I do not know anyone who has committed it to memory as good as I have done.\" Thus, he praised him for memorizing the Had\u012bth so accurately and was amazed at how well he memorized it, even though he did not witness the incident.\nIn the Had\u012bth: The one who serves water to people is the last among them to drink.\nAnd in it: Whoever oversleeps and fails to perform a prayer has to make up for the missed prayer.\nAnd in it: The Prophet's miracle in foretelling things of the Unseen, which Allah revealed to him, and in the blessing and increase of the little water.\nAnd in it: Serving virtuous people, especially during travel.\nAnd in it: Demonstrating some of the etiquettes related to taking rest during travel, namely, to avoid the road.\nAnd in it: Supplicating for the one who offers good service, as a reward for his doing good.\nAnd in it: Feeling sad and regretful over missed virtuous deeds, even if no negligence is involved.\nAnd in it: Making up for the missed supererogatory prayer.\nAnd in it: Urging the improvement of manners among people, particularly in situations involving crowdedness and annoyance.."}, {"number": 193, "hadith": "Abu Qat\u0101dah reported: When the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) alighted at night during a journey, he would lie down on his right side, and when he alighted before dawn, he would erect his forearm and place his head on his palm..", "commentary": "The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used to devote attention to the Prophet's guidance in his deeds, words, and approvals, to follow his example and learn from him. In this Had\u012bth, Abu Qat\u0101dah (may Allah be pleased with him) says that when the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went on a journey, he would alight in the first part of the night for sleep and rest, sleep on his right side, and place his head on a pillow or the like, thus giving himself the due share of sleep. And when he wanted to sleep at the latter part of the night, shortly before dawn, he would erect his right 'forearm' and \"place his head on his palm,\" fearing he might be overtaken by sleep and thus fail to perform the Fajr prayer at its earliest time. The right side is favored regarding sleep given the honor of tay\u0101mun (using the right side or starting with it) and its general merit in everything. It was the Prophet's habit to favor the right side, except in repulsive things, in which he would use the left side.\nThis also indicates that a person should give himself the due share of rest and not forget the worship of his Lord. In the first part of the night, he can get sufficient sleep before dawn and then get up. Yet in the latter part of the night, he should sleep lightly, rather than deeply, lest he may miss the Fajr prayer.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Alighting for rest during travel in case of tiredness, while being cautious not to miss the prayer\nAnd in it: Using alarms and the like to alert one to the times of prayers."}, {"number": 194, "hadith": "Ya\u2018la ibn Umayyah reported: I said to \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b: \"{There is no blame on you to shorten the prayer, if you fear that the disbelievers may harm you} [Surat an-Nis\u0101\u2019: 101]. And people have become secure!\" He said: \"I wondered about the same thing you wondered about, and I asked the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) about that, and he said: 'It is a charity that Allah has given you; so accept His charity.'\".", "commentary": "Travel is a piece of torment, and it is most likely to involve tiredness and hardship.

So, why do they shorten the prayer? Or what is the objective of shortening if its reason is no longer there? In response, \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) informed him that he had the same thought as Ya\u2018la ibn Umayyah and so he asked the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) about shortening the prayer in the absence of its reason - namely the fear from the enemy - and the existence of security, and the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) told him that shortening the prayer is a favor from Allah Almighty which He bestowed upon the Muslim Ummah and honored them with; it is a charity Allah has given them, by way of facilitation and mercy. \"So, accept His charity,\" i.e., whether there is fear or not; shortening the prayer is established in case of security as well. Allah's words: That the disbelievers may harm you} refers to what is most likely, for most of the journeys of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his Companions were not fear-free, given the multitude of fighting enemies at the time.\nThis indicates that the shortening of prayer during travel was prescribed to make things lenient and easy for people, and it does not have the sense of order or obligation for the traveler. Indeed, the Ummah unanimously agreed that a person to whom charity is offered is not obligated to accept it.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Shortening the prayer during travel with or without fear\nAnd in it: Demonstrating the mercy of Allah Almighty and His complete favor upon His servants, as He prescribed for Muslims to shorten the prayer during travel given the hardship they suffer.."}, {"number": 195, "hadith": "Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s reported: \"Allah has prescribed the prayer by the tongue of your Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) as four Rak\u2018ahs when resident, two when traveling, and one in case of fear..", "commentary": "Making things easy and light is one of the merits of the tolerant Islamic Shariah. Allah Almighty laid down dispensations for the Muslims therein so that they will not suffer hardship that causes them harm or burdens them with unbearable things. These dispensations include shortening the prayer during travel and at the time of war.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) says: \"Allah has prescribed the prayer by the tongue of your Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him)\" by revelation from Allah Almighty. So, it is \"four Rak\u2018ahs when resident,\" i.e., the four-Rak\u2018ah prayers: Zhuhr, \u2018Asr, and \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019- \"two when traveling;\" the four-Rak\u2018ah prayer is shortened to two Rak\u2018ahs only during travel. And He prescribed \"one in case of fear.\" The prayer of fear is when the time for obligatory prayer becomes due while Muslims are fighting an enemy, guarding borders, and the like. The Had\u012bth apparently indicates that the prayer of fear consists of one Rak\u2018ah in case of severe fear and war. It was said: What is meant by one Rak\u2018ah is that he offers one Rak\u2018ah with the Im\u0101m and one Rak\u2018ah alone. This is because most reports about the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) state that the prayer of fear consists of two Rak\u2018ahs, to be performed in different ways depending on the condition of the enemy in terms of nearness and remoteness. There is no effect for the severe fear, but they should perform two Rak\u2018ahs, according to their ability, in whatever direction they turn to, while walking and riding, nodding with their heads.."}, {"number": 196, "hadith": "M\u016bsa ibn Salamah al-Hudhali reported:  I asked Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s: \"How should I pray if I am in Makkah and did not pray with the Im\u0101m?\" He said: \"Two Rak\u2018ahs; the Sunnah of Abu al-Q\u0101sim (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\".", "commentary": "The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) were the most keen on following the Prophet's example in everything, because in the Prophet's Sunnah lies guidance and the right course; whoever follows it will be saved, and whoever deviates from it will be ruined.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i M\u016bsa ibn Salamah al-Hudhali asks Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him): \"How should I pray if I am in Makkah and did not pray with the Im\u0101m?\" This is because the Im\u0101m offers the prayer completely. So, if a traveler prays with him, he will also perform it completely. Yet, what should be the case if a traveler comes to Makkah and does not pray with the Im\u0101m? In response to him, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) said that he should pray it as two Rak\u2018ahs, in the shortened form, not as a complete prayer. Clarifying the reason for that, he said that this is the Sunnah of Abu al-Q\u0101sim, the nickname of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Indeed, the Sunnah as regards travelers is to shorten the prayers. Allah Almighty alleviated things for travelers and facilitated for them the Shar\u2018i rulings regarding prayer. So, he may shorten the four-Rak\u2018ah prayers (Zhuhr, \u2018Asr, and \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019) to two Rak\u2018ahs.."}, {"number": 197, "hadith": "Hafs ibn \u2018\u0100sim ibn \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b reported: I accompanied Ibn \u2018Umar on the road to Makkah and he led us in the Zhuhr prayer with two Rak\u2018ahs. Then, he went forward, and we too went along with him to a place where he alighted, and he sat, and we sat along with him. He cast a glance at the side where he offered the prayer and he saw people standing. He asked: \"What are they doing?\" I said: \"They are glorifying Allah.\" He said: \"If I were to glorify Allah, I would have completed my prayer. O my nephew, I accompanied the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) during travel, and he would not perform more than two Rak\u2018ahs, until he passed away.

Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) performed the Zhuhr prayer as two Rak\u2018ahs, shortening it. This is because the four-Rak\u2018ah prayer is to be shortened to two Rak\u2018ahs during travel. After the prayer, he came back to his place of stay, where he alighted. Some of those with them on the journey sat with Ibn \u2018Umar. He unintentionally looked back at the place where they had performed the obligatory prayer. There he saw people standing and offering prayer in addition to the prayer they had performed along with Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). He asked about them and about what prayer they were offering as an addition. His question was asked as a way of disapproving of them. Answering his question, Hafs ibn \u2018\u0100sim said that \"they are glorifying Allah\" i.e., they are performing the supererogatory prayer. Thereupon, Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) remarked: \"If I were to glorify Allah, I would have completed my prayer.\" In other words, if he was given the choice between completing the obligatory prayer and performing the regular Sunnah prayer, completing the obligatory prayer would be dearer to him, for he understood that shortening the prayer is meant for facilitation. Hence, he would not perform the regular Sunnah prayer or complete the obligatory prayer.\nThe supererogatory prayer here refers to the regular Sunnah prayer along with the obligatory prayers, like the Sunnah of the Zhuhr prayer and other obligatory prayers. It is not prescribed to perform the regular Sunnah prayers during travel, except for the two-Rak\u2018ah Sunnah of the Fajr prayer and the Witr prayer. As for the general supererogatory prayers, Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) used to offer them during travel, and he reported that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to offer them, as authentically narrated in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to glorify Allah on his riding animal in whatever direction it headed, and he would observe the Witr prayer thereon; yet, he would not perform the obligatory prayer upon it.\nThen, Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) pointed out the intent behind his disapproval, saying: \"O my nephew, I accompanied the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) during travel, and he would not perform more than two Rak\u2018ahs, until he passed away.\" The shortening applies to the four-Rak\u2018ah prayers: the Zhuhr, \u2018Asr, and \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019. One should not pray a supererogatory prayer before or after the obligatory prayer. And he said that he had accompanied Abu Bakr, \u2018Umar, and \u2018Uthm\u0101n (may Allah be pleased with them) at the time of their respective caliphates and authority, and they would not perform more than two Rak\u2018ahs during travel, until they passed away. This is because they were keen on adhering to and acting upon the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). The rightly-guided Caliphs continued to do so after the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), which indicates that this ruling was not subject to abrogation or opposition. And Allah Almighty says: {Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example.} [Surat al-Ahz\u0101b: 21], i.e., you should imitate the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and follow his example.\nAnd his following statement was confusing: \"Then, I accompanied \u2018Uthm\u0101n, and he would not perform more than two Rak\u2018ahs, until he passed away.\" This is because it is authentically reported in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections, in a Had\u012bth reported by Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), that \u2018Uthm\u0101n (may Allah be pleased with him) would complete the prayer after six or eight years. In reply to this, it was said that this version means that \u2018Uthm\u0101n (may Allah be pleased with him) would not perform more than two Rak\u2018ahs until he passed away anywhere other than Mina. Also, the famous narrations state that \u2018Uthm\u0101n used to complete the prayer after the early stage of his caliphate was understood, as he would do so at Mina in particular. It was said: \u2018Uthm\u0101n completed the prayer because he wanted to stay in Taif and he later had the opinion that it was not permissible for him to shorten the prayer in Mina, as shortening the prayer, in his view, applied to traveling pilgrims only, whereas residents may not shorten the prayer. And it was said: He completed the four-Rak\u2018ah prayers in consideration of public interest. This was since the people increased in number, and there would come for Hajj those who did not know the rulings of the religion. So, he feared the ignorant might think the basic rule regarding these prayers is that they consist of two Rak\u2018ahs; hence, he completed them.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Shortening the prayer during travel\nAnd in it: Abandoning the performance of supererogatory prayers during travel\nAnd in it: Demonstrating Ibn \u2018Umar's proper understanding of the religion\nAnd in it: The Companions adhered to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and followed in his footsteps.."}, {"number": 198, "hadith": "Yahya ibn Yaz\u012bd al-Hun\u0101\u2019i reported: I asked Anas ibn M\u0101lik about shortening the prayer, and he said: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would pray two Rak\u2018ahs when he went out on a journey of three miles or three leagues - Shu\u2018bah was doubtful..", "commentary": "Travel is a piece of torment, and it is most likely to involve tiredness and hardship.

Rain makes the ground untidy due to mud and other things. So, it was difficult for them to gather for prayer. Therefore, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to them: \"Whoever of you wishes may pray in his Rahl (dwelling).\" This was optional, not binding. So, whoever wished to pray in his dwelling did so, and whoever wished to go out for the congregational prayer did so. Rahl is the saddle of the camel. It here refers to the dwelling in which one passes the night during travel. This is part of the Shariah's making easy of things for the Muslims. This dispensation is not limited to travel only, but it also applies to the residents. \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that he said to his Muezzin on a rainy day: \"When you say 'Ashhadu An L\u0101 Il\u0101h illa Allah; Ashhadu Anna Muhammadan Ras\u016bl Allah' (I bear witness that there is no god but Allah; I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah), do not say: 'Hayy \u2018ala as-Sal\u0101h' (come to prayer); rather, say: 'Pray in your houses.'\" He said: The people seemed to have disapproved of that.

Are you teaching us about prayer, and we used to combine two prayers during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him)?!\".", "commentary": "The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) were extremely keen to apply the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and teach it to those who came after them.\nThis Had\u012bth is associated with a certain reason, as related in another version by Muslim; the T\u0101bi\u2018i \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn Shaq\u012bq reports that \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) addressed the people one day after \u2018Asr, till the sun set and the stars became visible. So, a man began to say to Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him): \"The prayer\" i.e., he was reminding him of the Maghrib prayer lest its time might pass. Meanwhile, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s kept silent and did not respond to him. The man repeated his reminder three times, and he did not respond to him in either of them. This continued till Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s said to him: \"May you be deprived of your mother\", a phrase the Arabs used to say by way of rebuke and criticism. Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s criticized him for his ignorance of the Sunnah of the Prophet and his frequent repetition. And he said: \"Are you teaching us about prayer?!\" He criticized him for reminding him while he did not forget it; rather, he intentionally delayed it, so as to teach them. Then, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s clarified the reason for his delay of the prayer; that is the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to combine two prayers along with his Companions, performing both of them together. This apparently would happen in case of need. Perhaps Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) was speaking about some matter of concern to the Muslims, and if he had cut it off and prayed, the interest involved in that matter would have been missed. So, he delayed the prayer for a particular need he deemed important. It is related in a version by Muslim that he combined two prayers without being in a state of fear or on a journey. When he was asked about that, he said: \"He wanted not to put anyone of his Ummah into hardship\" i.e., he only did that to avoid putting anyone of his Ummah into difficulty; thus, he alleviated things and made things easy for them when needed. The Had\u012bth was taken to apply to the excuse of illness. So, if something happens and calls for that, as a rarity, there is nothing wrong with that, in accordance with this Had\u012bth. But, for this to be something familiar and usual, this is not permissible, as the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) is not known to have done so persistently.\nThere are two ways to combine two prayers, according to what is conveniently possible: First: Combining two prayers at the time of the earlier one; for example, performing the \u2018Asr prayer along with the Zhuhr prayer at the time of Zhuhr, and performing the \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayer along with the Maghrib prayer at the time of Maghrib. Second: Combining two prayers at the time of the latter one; for example, performing the Zhuhr prayer along with the \u2018Asr prayer at the time of \u2018Asr, and performing the Maghrib prayer along with the \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayer at the time of \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019.."}, {"number": 203, "hadith": "Mu\u2018\u0101dh ibn Jabal reported: We went out with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in the year of the battle of Tab\u016bk, and he would combine the prayers. He performed the Zhuhr and \u2018Asr prayers together, and the Maghrib and \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayers together. And somedays, he delayed the prayer and then came out and performed the Zhuhr and \u2018Asr together. Then, he entered and thereafter went out and performed the Maghrib and \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayers together. He then said: \"You will come to the spring of Tab\u016bk tomorrow, Allah Willing, and you will not reach it until the forenoon. Whoever of you reaches it should not touch anything of its water until I come.\" We reached it and two men had come there ahead of us. The spring was like a shoelace, providing a thin flow of water. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked them: \"Did you touch anything of its water?\" They said: 'Yes.' Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) scolded them and said to them what Allah willed him to say. Then, they (the people) took water from the spring in their palms little by little until it became somewhat significant. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) washed his hands and face in it and then brought the water back to the spring whereupon the spring gushed forth with streaming water - or he said: abundant water - until the people drank water. Then, he said: \"If you live for long, O Mu\u2018\u0101dh, you will soon see what is here abounding with gardens.\".", "commentary": "Making things easy and lenient for the Muslims was the Prophet's approach, and the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) wanted to take his Ummah out of narrowness to broadness with regard to all matters. This can only be achieved by following his guidance, obeying him, and complying with his teachings.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Mu\u2018\u0101dh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that they went out with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in the year of the battle of Tab\u016bk, which took place in the ninth year after Hijrah. Tab\u016bk is in the northernmost part of the Arabian Peninsula, midway on the road to Damascus, and it lies around 1252 km away from Hejaz. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went out to invade the Romans. During this journey, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would combine every two prayers. He would perform the Zhuhr and \u2018Asr prayers together, and the Maghrib and \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayers together. He (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would perform the \u2018Asr prayer at the time of Zhuhr and perform the \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayer at the time of Maghrib, in what is called jam\u2018 taqd\u012bm (combining two prayers at the earlier time). Mu\u2018\u0101dh (may Allah be pleased with him) informed that one day the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) delayed the Zhuhr prayer to the time of \u2018Asr and delayed the Maghrib prayer to the time of \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019. This is called jam\u2018 ta\u2019kh\u012br (combining two prayers at the latter time).\nThen, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them): \"You will come\" in this travel and journey of yours; \"tomorrow\": the following morning; \"Allah Willing\", it is the Prophet's (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) compliance with the verse that reads: {And never say about anything: \"I will surely do this tomorrow,\" without adding: \"if Allah wills.\"} [Surat al-Kahf: 23-24] \"The spring of Tab\u016bk:\" It is the well of water after which the area was named. There was a little water gathered in it. \"and you will not reach it until the forenoon,\" i.e., the heat of the daytime grows intense with the coming of the forenoon. \"Whoever of you reaches it\" and moves faster and comes to it before the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) arrives - this is because it was the Prophet's habit to move and travel at the rear of the army - \"should not touch anything of its water,\" be it for drinking or other purposes, and whether it is little or much, until the Prophet's arrival. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) probably feared that if anyone touched the water before his arrival, it would cease to flow, given its little amount. So, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) wanted the blessing to appear in the water with his arrival and the water to suffice the entire army.\nThen, Mu\u2018\u0101dh (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"We reached it and two men had arrived there ahead of us.\" Two Muslim men who were at the front of the army. \"The spring:\" that which contains water, \"was like a shoelace:\" the string used for fastening shoes. This indicates the severe shortage of water. \"Providing a thin flow of water,\" i.e., it flows with little and thin water. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked the two men: \"Did you touch anything of its water?\" They replied in the affirmative. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) scolded them, which means he blamed and censured them. \"And said to them what Allah willed him to say,\" i.e., he blamed them vehemently. And perhaps they were hypocrites and violated the command intentionally, and so their scolding was deserved. It is also probable they were not hypocrites, yet they did not know about the Prophet's prohibition. And it is likely that his scolding of them happened to be misplaced; thus, it constituted mercy and purification for them. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said in a Had\u012bth narrated by Muslim: \"O Allah, I have entered into a covenant with You which You will not break. I am only a human being; so, if I have injured, reviled, cursed, or flogged a believer, make that for him a mercy, a purification, and a means by which You will bring him close to You on the Day of Resurrection.\"\nMu\u2018\u0101dh (may Allah be pleased with him) mentioned that the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) collected some water for the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in a vessel after they drew it in their palms. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) washed his hands and face in it and then commanded that the water be brought back to the spring. When they did so, the spring gushed forth with abundant and torrential water, and the people drank and quenched their thirst. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) told Mu\u2018\u0101dh (may Allah be pleased with him) to come close and hasten - O Mu\u2018\u0101dh - If Allah Almighty prolongs your life, you will see what is here filled with gardens. 'Gardens:' orchards of palm trees and other plants. The intended meaning is that the place will have plenty of water and its land will become fertile; thus, gardens with a lot of trees and fruits will grow there. This is one of the Prophet's miracles and signs of his prophethood, as this place thereafter became filled with plants and fruits and abounded with life.\nIn this Hadth: Combining two prayers during travel, whether the traveler is traveling or dwelling\nAnd in it: Two clear miracles for the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): the multitude of water, and his foretelling of some incidents of the Unseen.\nAnd in it: The verbal discipline and non-obscene and non-vulgar words or scolding.."}, {"number": 204, "hadith": "As-Suddi reported: I asked Anas: \"How should I leave after I pray?

Replying to him, Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said that he mostly saw the Messenger (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) turn to the right after finishing the prayer.\nIn a Had\u012bth narrated by Ahmad in his \"Musnad Collection,\" \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Amr ibn al-\u2018\u0100s (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"I saw him leave to his right, and I saw him leave to his left,\" i.e., he would leave, after finishing the prayer, towards any of the two directions, without restricting departure to one particular direction, whether he turned towards those he led in prayer or headed to leave the mosque.\nIn the \"Two Sah\u012bh Collections\", \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn Mas\u2018\u016bd (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"No one of you should give the devil anything of his prayer, thinking that it is due on him to leave only to his right. Indeed, I often saw the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) leave to his left.\" So, this matter has much leeway and no restriction.\nIt was said: that leaving to the right is preferable, but not obligatory, and there is nothing wrong with leaving towards the left side, as the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did the both. It was also said: that it depends on the need and necessity. If a person, after finishing the prayer, needs to go in a certain direction, he can turn to it, be it right or left.."}, {"number": 205, "hadith": "Al-Bar\u0101' ibn \u2018\u0100zib reported: When we prayed behind the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), we would like to be on his right side so that he would turn his face towards us. He said: I heard him say: \"My Lord, save me from Your punishment on the day You will resurrect - or gather - Your servants.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to urge the performance of the congregational prayer in the mosque in the first rows, and the Companions were keen on observing his commands.

Al-Bar\u0101\u2019 ibn \u2018\u0100zib (may Allah be pleased with him) mentions that whenever they prayed in the row behind the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), they were keen on being on his right side. He clarified the reason for this by saying that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would turn his face towards them, i.e., after making tasl\u012bm (the end of prayer), he would turn to the right, facing his Companions. Also, Al-Bar\u0101' (may Allah be pleased with him) informs that he heard the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) supplicate after the prayer, saying: \"My Lord, save me,\" i.e., protect me from Your punishment, \"on the day You will resurrect - or gather - Your servants,\" i.e., the Day of Resurrection, for reckoning. This is one of the most sublime supplications that point to the Prophet's fear of Allah Almighty.\nIn another version by Muslim: \"He did not mention: so that he would turn his face towards us.\" This version indicates the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was not persistent in turning to the right side after ending the prayer. In the \"Two Sah\u012bh Collections\", \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn Mas\u2018\u016bd (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"No one of you should give the devil anything of his prayer, thinking that it is due on him to leave only to his right.

The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) demonstrated the manner of praying and taught it to the Ummah, and he also taught us the order of prayers and what should be given precedence in case of conflict. The performance of the obligatory prayers takes precedence over offering the supererogatory ones.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) points out that when the muezzin proclaims the iq\u0101mah (the commencement of prayer) in the mosque, no one should embark upon the supererogatory prayer; rather, one should leave it and perform the obligatory prayer. His words \"there is no prayer\" probably mean that there is no prayer with a complete reward, or that the supererogatory prayer is not valid altogether after the proclamation of the iq\u0101mah for the obligatory prayer; so, one should cut off the supererogatory prayer and perform the obligatory one. It was said: If he was in the first Rak\u2018ah, he should cut off the prayer. Yet, if he is in the second Rak\u2018ah, he can complete the prayer in a quick manner.

These are words of reprimand and rebuke from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) for his performance of the supererogatory prayer while the Im\u0101m was offering the obligatory prayer.

They are held sacred in the hearts of the believers, and they are the place where prayers, individual and congregational, are performed, dhikr is observed, and Allah bestows His favor upon His servants by giving them great rewards.\nThis Had\u012bth addresses two of the etiquettes related to the mosque, to which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) gave direction. First: An etiquette related to entering the mosque. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"When anyone of you enters the mosque,\" i.e., wants to enter it, when he arrives at its door, \"let him say: O Allah, open for me the gates of Your mercy,\" which encompasses everything. This is an invocation to Allah to cover him with His vast mercy and enable him to perform the righteous deeds that will be a reason for entering through numerous gates of mercy.\nSecond: An etiquette related to leaving the mosque. He said: \"And when he leaves, let him say, O Allah, I ask You from Your bounty\" from Your lawful sustenance. This is an invocation to Allah and an acknowledgment that He is the Bestower of great favor upon His servants, the Provider, and the One Who gives out of His vast bounty without limit.\nIt was said: The reason for mentioning mercy with entering and bounty with leaving is that mercy in the Book of Allah is intended for the blessings related to people's souls and the Hereafter. Allah Almighty says: {But the mercy of your Lord is better than what they accumulate.} [Surat az-Zukhruf: 32] Whereas bounty is intended for worldly blessings. Allah Almighty says: {There is no blame upon you for seeking the bounty of your Lord [by trading].} [Surat al-Baqarah: 198] Allah Almighty also says: {When the prayer is over, disperse in the land and seek from the bounty of Allah.} [Surat al-Jumu\u2018ah: 10] When a person enters the mosque, he seeks closeness to Allah and engages in deeds that bring him near Allah's rewards and Paradise; so, the mention of mercy suits that. And when he leaves the mosque, he seeks sustenance; so, the mention of bounty suits that.\nThe supplications reported in such situations are intended for giving guidance and taking into account occasions, and they aim at connecting the servant to his Lord in all his conditions and activities, and reminding that Allah Almighty has power over all things and that He likes that His servants ask of Him. Allah Almighty says: {Your Lord says: \"Call upon Me; I will respond to you.\"} [Surat Gh\u0101fir: 60]\nIn the Had\u012bth: Urging remembrance of Allah upon entering the mosque and upon leaving it.."}, {"number": 209, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h reported:  We were with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) on an expedition. As we headed back, I urged my camel to move quickly as it was slow. A rider caught up with me from behind and he goaded my camel with an iron-tipped stick which he had with him. My camel moved forward like the best camel you have ever seen. I turned around and found him to be the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). He said: \"What makes you in a hurry, O J\u0101bir?\" I said: \"O Messenger of Allah, I am newly wedded.\" He said: \"Have you married a virgin or a previously married woman?\" He said: I said: \"A previously married woman.\" He said: \"Why not a young girl so that you could play with her and she could play with you?\" He said: Then, when we reached Mad\u012bnah and were about to enter, He said: \"Wait so that we may enter by night - i.e., in the evening - in order for the one of unkempt hair to comb her hair and the one whose husband has been absent to shave her pubic hair.\" He said: And he said: \"When you enter, then Al-Kays, Al-Kays (copulation; or discernment).\".", "commentary": "Marriage is part of Fitrah (natural disposition) and one of the immutable laws of Allah in this world, and it serves many Shar\u2018i interests. Our pure Shariah devoted attention to this Fitrah and urged and encouraged it. It directed us to the right way of choosing and the means for preserving this sublime blessing, through good manners and an amicable relationship between a man and his wife.\nIn this Had\u012bth, J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) informs that they were with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) on an expedition outside Mad\u012bnah. It is said: This happened during the Conquest of Makkah, as they were returning from Makkah to Mad\u012bnah. On their way back to Mad\u012bnah, J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) was in a hurry and quickened the pace of driving his camel, which was slow. Someone caught up with him from behind and goaded his camel, i.e., he struck it at the rear to hasten its pace, \"with an iron-tipped stick which he had with him.\" That is a stick that resembles a spear. The camel hastened its pace and moved vigorously \"like the best camels you have ever seen\" i.e., like the best and fastest camels you ever see. J\u0101bir turned his head around to see who goaded his camel and hastened its pace and found him to be the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked him about the reason for his being in haste and quickening his pace. In reply to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), he said that he was \"newly wedded\" i.e., he got married a short while ago. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked him whether he had married a virgin, who did not marry before, or a previously married woman. J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) informed him that he married a previously married woman, not a virgin. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: \"Why not a young girl\"; this means a virgin. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was encouraging him to marry virgins. \"so that you could play with her and she could play with you?\" i.e., you have fun with her, and she has fun with you, and you fondle her, and she fondles you. Indeed, a previously married woman may feel attached to her former husband, unlike a young girl who did not marry before; her heart usually gets attached to her first husband. So, she actively cares about him and seeks to make him happy - in addition to other traits for which virgins are known and by which they surpass previously married women. In the Two Sah\u012bh Collections: I said: \"O Messenger of Allah, my father died - or he was martyred - and I have small sisters. So, I disliked that I should marry someone like them and she would not be able to discipline them and look after them. Therefore, I have married a previously married woman so that she would be able to look after them and discipline them.\" The version by Muslim has this addition: \"May Allah bless you; or he said something good to me.\"\nThen, J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) informed that when they returned to Mad\u012bnah, they hastened to enter and go to their families. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Wait\" i.e., be patient and wait, and do not go to your families, \"so that we may enter by night, i.e., in the evening\" i.e., after the \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayer. He clarified the reason for the delay, saying: \"in order for the one of unkempt hair to comb her hair\" i.e., to prune and beautify the hair of her head. \"the one of unkempt hair\" is one whose hair became untidy and ugly in appearance. \"and the one whose husband has been absent to shave her pubic hair\"; using the razor blade to remove the pubic hair. \"and the one whose husband has been absent\" is called Al-Mugh\u012bbah in Arabic. The intended meaning is that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) prevented them from hastening to go to their families and commanded them to wait till the night, so as to give their women an opportunity to get prepared for them, tidy their appearances and hair, beautify themselves, and be ready to receive them. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) advised J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him), saying: \"When you enter\" i.e., when you go to your wife; \"then Al-Kays, Al-Kays.\" It is said: It means copulation. So, he seemed to have encouraged him to engage in copulation. And it is said: Rather, he meant something more specific than that, namely the child. So, he seemed to have encouraged him to have a child. It is also said: It refers to reason and forbearance.

He said: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) followed me, made supplication for me, and struck it. Thereupon, it went in a way that it had never done before. He said: \"Sell it to me for one \u2019Uqiya.\" I replied: 'No.' He again said: \"Sell it to me.\" So, I sold it to him for one \u2019Uqiya. However, I stipulated that I should be allowed to ride it home. Then, when I reached (home), I took the camel to him, and he paid me its price in cash. Then, I went back, and he sent someone after me. He said: \"Do you think that I bargained with you to take your camel? Take your camel and your money; it is yours.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to be aware of the conditions of his Companions in terms of richness and poverty and opulence and straits.

It was said that this occurred during the Conquest of Makkah and that they were returning from Makkah to Mad\u012bnah. He wanted to release it in the desert. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) caught up with him, supplicated for him, and struck the camel. J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the camel became strong and fast after the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) struck it, and it walked in a way like never before. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked J\u0101bir to sell the camel to him for one \u2019Uqiya of silver, which is worth 40 Dirhams or approximately 201 grams. J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) refused to sell it to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Yet, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) repeated his offer, to which J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) agreed, and he set a condition to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) that he should not take the camel before arriving in Mad\u012bnah and let J\u0101bir ride it until he reached there. When they reached Mad\u012bnah, J\u0101bir went to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) with the camel. Upon receiving the camel, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) gave him its price in cash. As J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) returned, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) sent someone after him to call him back. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: \"Do you think that I bargained with you to take your camel?!\" Bargaining: It is to negotiate a transaction with the aim of reducing the price. The meaning: Do you think that I negotiated with you about your camel so as to take it from you?! \"Take your camel and your money; it is yours.\" It is as if the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) wanted to say to him: I only intended to find a reason to give you money. J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) was taking care of his sisters after the death of his father in the battle of \u2019Uhud. This shows the Prophet's care about the conditions of his Companions.\nIn the Had\u012bth: It is legitimate to ask to buy some commodity even if its owner does not offer it for sale and to bargain about the price.\nAnd in it: Stipulating a certain benefit related to the sold object\nAnd in it: Cash payment of the price should be made upon receiving the commodity.\nAnd in it: It is legitimate to sell a camel with the exception of its riding.\nAnd in it: Demonstrating that if a sale is made with a condition that does not contradict the purpose of the contract, the sale and the condition are valid.."}, {"number": 211, "hadith": "J\u0101bir reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade that a man should come to his wife by night doubting her fidelity or trying to find her lapses.

He then clarified the reason for the prohibition, saying: \"doubting her fidelity or trying to find her lapses,\" i.e., thinking she is unfaithful or exposing her secret as to whether she has committed infidelity or not. So, it is disliked for a man who has been on a long journey to unexpectedly return to his wife by night. Yet, if he is on a short journey and his wife expects his return by night, there is nothing wrong with that.\nIn [the Two Sah\u012bh Collections]: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would not come to his family by night. He used to come to them in the early morning or in the evening. He would not come to his family if he returned from travel by night. Rather, he would come to them in the early morning, which extends from the Fajr prayer to the sunrise, or in the evening, which extends from noon - the time of the Zhuhr prayer - to sunset. This is because when a man comes to his wife by night, he takes her by surprise and she may not be ready to receive her husband, who has been away from her for a period of time. So, it is appropriate for him not to come to her unexpectedly at night.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Forbidding that a man should spy on his wife or come to her unexpectedly by night after return from travel\nAnd in it: Urging pursuit of the means that bring cordiality and love between the two spouses\nAnd in it: Exhorting the avoidance of such things that entail mistrust of the Muslim."}, {"number": 212, "hadith": "\u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn Shaq\u012bq reported: I said to \u2018\u0100'ishah: \"Did the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) use to perform the Duha (forenoon) prayer?\" She said: \"No, unless he came back from his absence.\".", "commentary": "Prayer is a tawq\u012bfi (determined) act of worship that must be taken from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).

The Duha prayer, also called the Duha Subha, is to be performed after the sun rises and goes as high as the length of a spear - that is nearly 15 minutes after sunshine - and its time ends shortly before noon. In reply, she said that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not use to offer the Duha prayer, except when he came from his absence, i.e., from travel. This is because he forbade that a man should come to his wife by night after returning from travel. So, he would come in the early morning and go first to the mosque, where he would pray at the time of Duha (forenoon).\nIn a version by Muslim, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to offer the Duha prayer as four Rak\u2018ahs and add as many Rak\u2018ahs as he willed.

Sul\u0101ma, in Arabic, originally refers to the bones of fingers, hands, and legs, and then it was later used to refer to all the body parts. So, every morning, a person is required to give charity for every organ of his body, in gratitude to Allah Almighty for His great favors. Indeed, the structure of bones and their joints is one of the great favors Allah has bestowed upon His servants. Hence, each bone requires a charity to be given by the person for it, as gratitude for this blessing. Charity here is intended as something recommended and encouraged, not obligatory or binding, for it is sufficient as gratitude for these favors to perform the obligations and shun the prohibitions. Then, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) guides to some acts of piety which a person may perform as charity for his joints. \"Every Tasb\u012bh\" (glorification of Allah) - saying: Subh\u0101n Allah (glory be to Allah) - \"is an act of charity\"; \"every Tahm\u012bd\" (praise of Allah) - saying: Al-Hamdulill\u0101h (praise be to Allah) - \"is an act of charity\"; \"every Tahl\u012bl\" (proclamation of Allah's oneness) - saying: L\u0101 Il\u0101ha illa Allah (there is no god but Allah) - \"is an act of charity\"; \"and every Takb\u012br\" - saying: All\u0101hu Akbar (Allah is the Greatest) - \"is an act of charity\"; \"and enjoining Ma\u2018r\u016bf (what is good) is an act of charity and forbidding Munkar (what is evil) is an act of charity.\" Likewise, all other forms of Dhikr and worship are charities for oneself. Ma\u2018r\u016bf: It is a term that comprises all what is known to be a form of obedience to Allah Almighty and benevolence to people. Munkar: It refers to all offensive deeds and words that lead to disobedience to Allah Almighty; and it is a term that comprises all forms of evil. So, if anyone performs the mentioned acts of goodness and the like, it should be equal in number to the 360 joints.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informs that \"two Rak\u2018ahs which one offers in the forenoon\" are sufficient in place of all that, for prayer is an act that is done by all the body parts and it includes all the mentioned charities and others. This demonstrates the great merit of the Duha prayer. The time of the Duha prayer starts 15 minutes after sunrise and extends to also 15 minutes before soon. The minimum in the Duha prayer is two Rak\u2018ahs, and the maximum is eight Rak\u2018ahs, as related in a Had\u012bth in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections, in which \u2019Umm H\u0101ni\u2019 (may Allah be pleased with her) reported: \"that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) took a bath in her house on the day of the Conquest of Makkah and prayed eight Rak\u2018ahs.\" It is said: There is no limit to its maximum, as indicated by a Had\u012bth by Muslim, in which \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported: \"The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to offer the Duha prayer as four Rak\u2018ahs and pray as much more as he wished.\"."}, {"number": 215, "hadith": "\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah reported: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would not observe any of the supererogatory prayers more regularly than the two Rak\u2018ahs before Fajr..", "commentary": "Islam encouraged and urged the performance of supererogatory prayers and made them greatly rewardable.

Then, he would enter his house after finishing the \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayer and offer two Rak\u2018ahs as Sunnah of the \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayer.\nHe would offer Qiy\u0101m al-Layl (late-night voluntary prayer) with nine Rak\u2018ahs, including the Witr, which is the last prayer a Muslim performs after the voluntary prayer in the night prayer. It is authentically reported that he used to pray eleven Rak\u2018ahs, and it is also authentically reported that he used to pray thirteen Rak\u2018ahs.\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would sometimes offer his late-night prayer while standing and sometimes sitting. Her words \"for a long night\" mean: for a long time during the night.\nAnother trait of the Prophet's prayer is that if he commenced his prayer at night with recitation while standing, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would bow and prostrate in the well-known manner: going down for ruk\u016b\u2018 and then returning to the standing position and going down for prostration and then returning to the standing position, and so on. And if he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commenced his prayer at night with recitation while sitting, he would engage in ruk\u016b\u2018 and prostration without standing for them, neither before nor after observing them.\nAnd when the time of the Fajr prayer came, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would offer two Rak\u2018ahs as Sunnah of Fajr. In the version by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd: \"Then, he would go out and lead the people in the Fajr prayer.\"\nIn the Had\u012bth: Offering supererogatory prayers while sitting without an excuse\nAnd in it: Offering the supererogatory prayers at home."}, {"number": 221, "hadith": "\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah reported:  that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not die until most of his prayers were performed while sitting..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was the best among people in worshiping his Lord and standing before Him, Exalted be He.

This refers to the supererogatory prayers, not the obligatory ones. That was one or two years before his death, as related in Sah\u012bh Muslim Collection from Hafsah (may Allah be pleased with her), given that he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was too weak to stand for long.

Then, one year before his death - and in another version: one or two years - he would pray while sitting, that is because he put on weight and his body weakened due to old age, according to a Had\u012bth narrated in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections and reported by \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her).\nShe informed that he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to recite a Surah of the Qur'an during his prayer, and he would recite in a so measured and deliberate manner \"that it became longer than longer Surahs\" i.e., due to his measured way of reciting, the duration of reciting a Surah would become longer than the duration of reciting another bigger Surah in terms of the length and the number of verses.\nThe Had\u012bth mentions the recitation of the Qur'an in a measured and deliberate manner.\nIt also includes the performance of supererogatory prayers while sitting.."}, {"number": 224, "hadith": "\u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Amr reported:  It was narrated to me that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"The prayer of a man while sitting is half a prayer.\" He said: I came to him and found him praying while sitting. I placed my hand on his head. He said: \"What is the matter with you, O \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Amr?\" I said: \"It was narrated to me - O Messenger of Allah - that you said: 'The prayer of a man while sitting is half a prayer'; and you pray while sitting.\" He said: \"Yes, but I am not like any of you.\".", "commentary": "Prayer is the mainstay of religion, and its performance is obligatory for every Muslim. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) demonstrated the manner of performing prayer and taught it to the Ummah.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that it was narrated to him that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) stated that the prayer of a man while sitting is \"half a prayer\" i.e., it brings half of the reward of someone who performs it while standing. So, this makes it valid and detracts from its reward. This Had\u012bth is taken to refer to performing a supererogatory prayer while sitting despite being able to stand. However, if a person performs a supererogatory prayer while sitting because he is unable to stand, his reward does not decrease; rather, his reward is like praying while standing. As for the obligatory prayer, it is invalid to perform it while sitting despite being able to stand. Yet, if a person is unable to stand, then his sitting is tantamount to his standing.\nThen, \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) informed that he came to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) one day and found him praying while sitting. He placed his hand on the Prophet's head, wondering at his prayer while sitting and wanting the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to look towards him. This was after he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had finished the prayer, for it is not thought that \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) would put his hand before that. This behavior is not deemed impolite among some Arabs, as they tend to behave naturally. Moreover, this shows the Prophet's modesty and good character, and that he used to deal and associate with his close Companions like being one of them and not exalting himself above them. When the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) sensed the hand of \u2018Abdull\u0101h, he asked him: \"What is the matter with you?\" i.e., what is wrong with you?! So, he told him about the aforementioned Had\u012bth, by way of inquiry, not as an objection or disapproval. His words \"and you pray while sitting\" affirmed the point that was confusing and unclear to him, and how the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would be content with half a reward for himself. In response, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) confirmed the Had\u012bth he cited and then said: \"but I am not like any of you\" i.e., what you have mentioned that the prayer of a man while sitting is half of his prayer while standing is a ruling that applies to people other than me in this Ummah and it pertains to them; as for me, I am not subject to this ruling, and my Lord accepts from me my prayer while sitting for a reward like that of my prayer while standing. This is one of the peculiar merits of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), as his performance of a supererogatory prayer while sitting, though he was able to stand, was made equivalent to his performance of it while standing, as an honor for him.\nThe Had\u012bth urges the performance of prayer in its complete form for those who are able to. So, if a person is able to stand, he should pray while standing, in both obligatory and supererogatory prayers.\nIt points out how Allah Almighty favors His Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and distinguishes him from all the Ummah.."}, {"number": 225, "hadith": "Abu Salamah reported: I asked \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah about the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and she said: \"He used to offer thirteen Rak\u2018ahs; he would perform eight Rak\u2018ahs and then observe the Witr and then perform two Rak\u2018ahs while sitting; when he wanted to bow, he would stand up and bow. Then, he would offer two Rak\u2018ahs between the Adh\u0101n and iq\u0101mah of the Fajr prayer..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to pray as much Qiy\u0101m al-Layl in his house as Allah willed him to pray. The Companions and the T\u0101bi\u2018is after them were keen on knowing about his acts of worship in detail and ask about what they could not see of his worship at home.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Abu Salamah ibn \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n says that he asked the Mother of the Believers, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), about the Qiy\u0101m al-Layl of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and the number of its Rak\u2018ahs and the manner of its  performance. She informed him that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to perform thirteen Rak\u2018ahs; he would perform eight Rak\u2018ahs, two Rak\u2018ahs each, as narrated in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections, and he would then pray the Witr, i.e., with the ninth Rak\u2018ah. As narrated in a version by Muslim: \"Nine Rak\u2018ahs while standing and he would perform one of them as the Witr,\" i.e., he would make the last Rak\u2018ah among them the Witr of his prayer. In another version by Muslim: \"He would observe five Rak\u2018ahs of which was the Witr, not sitting except at the last of them,\" i.e., he used to offer four Rak\u2018ahs, two Rak\u2018ahs each, and then perform the fifth Rak\u2018ah as the Witr, not sitting for tashahhud except in the last Rak\u2018ah. In another version by Muslim: \"The prayer of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in the night consisted of ten Rak\u2018ahs, and then he would observe the Witr with one Rak\u2018ah and offer the two Rak\u2018ahs of Fajr; those are thirteen Rak\u2018ahs.\" This denotes the diversity of the Prophet's Qiy\u0101m al-Layl in terms of duration and the number of Rak\u2018ahs, depending on his condition and energy.\nAlso, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to perform two Rak\u2018ahs while sitting. Apparently, these two Rak\u2018ahs were after the Witr and before the time of Fajr. When he wanted to perform ruk\u016b\u2018 while in this state of sitting, he would stand up and then bow down in the well-known manner. Then, when the time of Fajr came, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would offer the two-Rak\u2018ah Sunnah of Fajr, after the Adh\u0101n and before the iq\u0101mah of the Fajr prayer.\nThere are numerous other well-known Had\u012bths, in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections and elsewhere, that enjoin making the last prayer in Qiy\u0101m al-Layl the Witr. An example is a Had\u012bth in which \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Make the last of your prayer at night the Witr.\" As for these two Rak\u2018ahs which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) offered after the Witr and before Fajr, this is to demonstrate the permissibility of praying after the Witr, and they were not performed on a persistent basis, for what the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did persistently was to conclude with the Witr, as mentioned above.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Praying at night while sitting."}, {"number": 226, "hadith": "Abu Is'h\u0101q reported:  I asked Al-Aswad ibn Yaz\u012bd about what \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah narrated to him regarding the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). She said: He would sleep in the earlier part of the night and stay awake in the latter part. Then, when he needed intercourse with his wife, he would fulfill his need and then sleep. When the first call was pronounced, she said: He jumped - and no by Allah, she did not say: He stood up - and poured water over himself - and no by Allah, she did not say: He took a bath, and I know what she meant - and if he was not sexually impure, he would perform ablution like a man's ablution for prayer and then offer two Rak\u2018ahs..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would offer Qiy\u0101m al-Layl in his house as much as Allah willed him to pray.

He told him that she had said: \"He would sleep at the earlier part of the night\" after the \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayer, in order to give his body its share of rest. And he would get up at the latter part of the night to fill it with prayer, Tahajjud, and Witr. This is the time in which Allah Almighty descends to the worldly heaven, as related in a Had\u012bth by Al-Bukh\u0101ri and Muslim, in which Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Our Lord, Glorified and Exalted, descends every night to the worldly heaven when the last third of the night remains and says: \u2018Who supplicates Me so that I may answer him? Who asks Me so that I may give him? Who seeks forgiveness from Me so that I may forgive him?'\"\nThen, when he finished his prayer in the night, he would fulfill his need for his wives, in case he had a need for them. In the version by An-Nas\u0101\u2019i: \"he would go to his wife\", which indirectly refers to copulation; and then he would then sleep. Thereafter, when the time of Fajr came and he heard the Adh\u0101n - the first call - he would 'jump' i.e., he would get up in a quick and active manner, and he would pour water over himself, taking a ritual bath if he was sexually impure from the copulation with his wives. In case he was not sexually impure, he would only make ablution and then offer two Rak\u2018ahs as the Sunnah of Fajr.\nBy his words: \"No by Allah, she did not say: He stood up\" and \"No by Allah, she did not say: He took a bath, and I know what she meant\", the narrator means that he conveyed the very words said by \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), which are: \"and he poured water over himself\"; and she did not say: \"He took a bath\". And he knows that by \"he poured water\", she meant: He took a bath. This shows his care and meticulousness in conveying what he heard as he heard it, not by its meaning.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that a sexually impure person may sleep without performing ablution.\nIt shows the interest in worship and the active engagement in it, as denoted by the words \"he jumped\".."}, {"number": 227, "hadith": "\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to pray at night until his last prayer would be the Witr..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to offer Qiy\u0101m al-Layl in his house as much as Allah willed him to pray.

When the dawn rose, there would be no Witr, even between the Adh\u0101n of Fajr and its Iq\u0101mah.\nThere are various forms and ways of the Prophet's performance of Witr, as well as the number of its Rak\u2018ahs. Based on all of them, it becomes apparent that Witr can be three, five, seven, nine, or eleven Rak\u2018ahs. If he observed Witr as three Rak\u2018ahs, this would have two legitimate ways: First: He would offer the three Rak\u2018ahs consecutively with one Tashahhud. Second: He would make Tasl\u012bm after two Rak\u2018ahs and then offer one Rak\u2018ah as Witr. But when he observed Witr as five or seven Rak\u2018ahs, he would offer them all together, with only one Tashahhud and Tasl\u012bm at the end. And when he observed Witr as nine Rak\u2018ahs, he would offer them all together and sit for Tashahhud at the eighth Rak\u2018ah and then stand up without Tasl\u012bm, and he would say Tashahhud in the ninth Rak\u2018ah and make Tasl\u012bm. When he observed Witr as eleven Rak\u2018ahs, he would make Tasl\u012bm after every two Rak\u2018ahs and then conclude them with one Rak\u2018ah. The minimum of what is valid and sufficient in terms of Witr is to perform two Rak\u2018ahs and make Tasl\u012bm and then perform one Rak\u2018ah and make Tasl\u012bm; and it is permissible to make one Tasl\u012bm, but with one Tashahhud, not two.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that the last prayer at night should be Witr.."}, {"number": 228, "hadith": "Zur\u0101rah reported:  Sa\u2018d ibn Hish\u0101m ibn \u2018\u0100mir wanted to fight for the sake of Allah. So, he came to Mad\u012bnah and wanted to sell some real estate that belonged to him there, allocate it for arms and horses, and conduct Jihad against the Romans until he dies. When he came to Mad\u012bnah, he met a group of people from Mad\u012bnah, who forbade him from doing so. They informed him that a group of six people wanted to do that during the lifetime of the Prophet of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), yet the Prophet of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade them. He said: Is there not a role model for you in me?! When they narrated that to him, he took back his wife, whom he had divorced, and he brought witnesses to her return. He came to Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s and asked him about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s said: Shall I direct you to the most knowledgeable one among the people of the world about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him)? He said: Who? He said: \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah. Go to her and ask her and then come to me and tell me about her response to you. So, I headed to her. I met Hak\u012bm ibn Aflah and asked him to take me to her. He said: I would not come close to her, for I forbade her from saying anything about these two groups, but she refused and decided to engage in that. He said: I adjured him by Allah. As a result, he came, and we headed to \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah. We asked her for permission to enter. She gave us permission, and we entered her place. She said: Are you Hak\u012bm? She recognized him. He said: Yes. She said: Who is with you? He said: Sa\u2018d ibn Hish\u0101m. She said: Who is Hish\u0101m? He said: Ibn \u2018\u0100mir. She invoked Allah's mercy upon him and spoke well of him. Qat\u0101dah said: He was wounded during the battle of \u2019Uhud. I said: O Mother of the Believers, tell me about the character of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). She said: Do you not recite the Qur\u2019an? I said: Yes. She said: Indeed, the character of the Prophet of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was the Qur\u2019an. He said: I resolved to get up and not ask anyone about anything till I die; then a thought came to me, and I said: Tell me about the Qiy\u0101m (late-night prayer) of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). She said: Do you not recite: {O you the enwrapped one}? I said: Yes. She said: Indeed, Allah Almighty prescribed Qiy\u0101m al-Layl at the start of this Surah. So, the Prophet of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his Companions performed Qiy\u0101m for one year. And Allah held back its concluding portion for twelve months in heaven, till Allah sent down alleviation at the concluding verses of this Surah. Consequently, Qiy\u0101m al-Layl became optional after being obligatory. He said: I said: O Mother of the Believers, tell me about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). She said: We used to prepare for him his tooth stick and water for his ablution, and Allah would resurrect him to the extent He wished during the night. He would use the tooth stick, perform ablution, and offer nine Rak\u2018ahs, without sitting in them except in the eighth one; he would remember Allah, praise Him, and supplicate Him, and then get up without making Tasl\u012bm and offer the ninth Rak\u2018ah. Then, he would sit, remember Allah, praise Him, supplicate Him, and then make Tasl\u012bm loud enough for us to hear. Then, he would offer two Rak\u2018ahs after Tasl\u012bm while he was sitting. These are eleven Rak\u2018ahs, O young son. When the Prophet of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) grew old and put on weight, he would observe Witr with seven and do in the two Rak\u2018ahs as he had done formerly. These are nine, O young son. When the Prophet of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) offered a prayer, he liked to offer it on a persistent basis. But if he missed Qiy\u0101m al-Layl due to sleep or illness, he would perform twelve Rak\u2018ahs during the daytime. I am not aware that the Prophet of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) recited the whole Qur\u2019an in a night, prayed for a night till the morning, or fasted a whole month other than Ramadan. He said: Then I headed to Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s and told him her Had\u012bth. He said: She spoke the truth. If I could come close to her or visit her, I would certainly go to her so that she would verbally narrate it to me. He said: I said: If I had known you would not enter her place, I would not have narrated her Had\u012bth to you.

Sa\u2018d ibn Hish\u0101m acted upon the advice given to him by those people. So, he took back his wife. A man can take back his wife if he divorced her for the first or second time and her waiting period is yet to end. He brought witnesses to her return as a wife to him, which he did in compliance with the verse that reads: {Then when they have approached the end of their waiting period, either retain them honorably or part with them honorably. Call two just men from among yourselves as witnesses.} [Surat at-Tal\u0101q: 2]\nThereafter, Sa\u2018d went to \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) and asked him about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Witr is the last prayer a Muslim observes after performing the supererogatory Qiy\u0101m al-Layl, the best voluntary act of worship to be performed by a Muslim. Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) said to him: \"Shall I direct you to the most knowledgeable one among the people of the world about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him)?\" Meaning, that the best one to tell you about it from among the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and who is more knowledgeable about it than others, though Witr is a famous act that is known to the knowledgeable and others. However, since Sa\u2018d particularly linked his question to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), it was more appropriate that specialists should provide the answer, as long as they were present. So, Sa\u2018d asked him about that person. Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) said to him: \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah, the Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her). And he instructed him to go and pose his question to her and then return and tell him about her response and answer. Indeed, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was more knowledgeable about that because Witr is a night prayer that is performed at home. So, the Mothers of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with them) had more knowledge about it, and the foremost among them was \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), given her great keenness to memorize the traditions of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\nSo, Sa\u2018d dashed off and went to her, as he was ordered by Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him). On his way, he passed by the T\u0101bi\u2018i Hak\u012bm ibn Aflah. He asked him to accompany him and go with him to \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her). Ibn Aflah said: \"I would not come close to her\" i.e., I do not want to be near her and will not go with you to her. \"for I forbade her from saying anything about these two groups\" i.e., the two factions, which refers to the group of \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) and the group of Az-Zubayr ibn al-\u2018\u0650Aww\u0101m and Talhah ibn \u2018Ubaydull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with both of them). The meaning: I forbade her from getting in this occurring war; but she refused and did not comply, and she insisted on going ahead with what she wanted. She sided with the opponents of \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) in the battle of the Camel.\nSa\u2018d informed that he adjured him by Allah and appealed to him to go to \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her). Hak\u012bm agreed, and they went together to \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her). They asked her for permission to enter. \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) gave them permission to enter. She asked the one who entered: Are you Hak\u012bm? She recognized him, probably by his voice when he greeted her. In response, Hak\u012bm said: Yes. She asked him about the one accompanying him. Hak\u012bm told her that he was Sa\u2018d ibn Hish\u0101m. She asked about who Hish\u0101m was. Hak\u012bm informed her that he was Hish\u0101m ibn \u2018\u0100mir ibn \u2019Umayyah (may Allah be pleased with him). Thereupon, she invoked Allah's mercy upon \u2018\u0100mir and spoke well of him. In another version in the Sah\u012bh Muslim Collection: \"What an excellent man \u2018\u0100mir was.\" \u2018\u0100mir (may Allah be pleased with him) was one of those who were martyred and killed in the battle of \u2019Uhud, in the third Hijri year.\nSa\u2018d asked her: O Mother of the Believers, tell me about the character of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). She said to Sa\u2018d: \"Do you not recite the Qur\u2019an?\" This is an affirmative question, for she knew he was one of those who recited the Qu\u2019an. He replied: Yes. i.e., he was one of those who recited the Qur\u2019an. So, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said to him: \"She said: Indeed, the character of the Prophet of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was the Qur\u2019an,\" i.e., he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) assumed all the noble manners enjoined in the Qur\u2019an and abided by them, and he avoided all that is prohibited therein. So, his character was to act upon it, stop at its limits, adopt its ethics, and take lessons from its examples and stories.\nThen, Sa\u2018d informed that he thought to himself that he would leave her place and depart and never ask anyone about anything of the Prophet's character till he died, for she comprehensively described to him the Prophet's noble manners and good morals. She referred him to the noble Qur\u2019an which comprises all excellent attributes. So, he could explore the Prophet's character from it, generally and specifically. Thus, nothing of his manners would remain for him to need to ask about.\nAfter he resolved to leave the place of \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), he entertained the idea of asking her about the Qiy\u0101m al-Layl of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his supererogatory worship during the night. As he asked her to tell him about that, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) asked him: \"Do you not recite: {O you the enwrapped one}?\" i.e., the whole Surah. He replied that he recited it. She said: \"Indeed, Allah Almighty prescribed\" i.e., He ordained the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his Companions to perform \"Qiy\u0101m al-Layl in the start of this Surah.\" This occurs in the verse that reads: {Stand up in prayer at night except a little.} [Surat al-Muzzammil: 2] As a result, the Prophet of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his Companions prayed during the night for a whole year. In the version by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd: \"till their feet became swollen.\" And Allah Almighty held back with Him the concluding portion of this Surah - which contains alleviation and facilitation by prescribing the recitation of as much of the Qur\u2019an as is easy - for twelve months in the heaven, till Allah sent down alleviation at the end of this Surah, in the verse that reads: {Indeed, your Lord knows that you [O Prophet] stand up in prayer for nearly two-thirds of the night, or half of it, or one-third of it, as do others among your companions. Allah determines the night and the day; He knows that you [Muslims] cannot keep an accurate count of it, so He pardoned you. Recite then as much of the Qur\u2019an as is easy for you [in the night prayers]. He knows that there are some among you who will be ill, and others traveling in the land, seeking the grace of Allah, and others fighting in Allah\u2019s way. So recite as much of it as is easy for you; establish prayer and give Zakah; and lend to Allah a goodly loan. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will find it with Allah, much better in condition and much greater in reward. And seek forgiveness of Allah, for indeed Allah is All-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.} [Surat al-Muzzammil: 20] Consequently, Qiy\u0101m al-Layl became optional after being obligatory.\nShe (may Allah be pleased with her) was disputed over the period between the revelation of the beginning of the verse and the revelation of its end. It is said: After ten years, which is apparently correct view, for the Surah is a Makkan one, and it was one of the first verses of the Qur\u2019an to be revealed, except for the two concluding verses of it, which were revealed in Mad\u012bnah.\nThen, Sa\u2018d ibn Hish\u0101m asked her about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), the manner of its performance, and the number of its Rak\u2018ahs. She (may Allah be pleased with her) told him that they used to prepare for him (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) his tooth stick and the water for his ablution, so that he would perform ablution after getting up from sleep. This is because he used to sleep after the \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayer and then \"Allah would resurrect him\". She used the word 'resurrect' because sleep is similar to death. In other words, He would awaken him from sleep. So, he would use the tooth stick, make ablution, and offer nine connected Rak\u2018ahs without sitting or making Tasl\u012bm therein except in the eighth Rak\u2018ah, after which he would sit for Tashahhud, and \"he would remember Allah\" i.e., he would say Tashahhud, and praise Allah, ascribing to Him the attributes of perfection that befit Him, and supplicate Him and ask Him for the fulfillment of his needs. Then, he would rise from the eighth Rak\u2018ah, without making Tasl\u012bm thereafter, and offer the ninth Rak\u2018ah. Then, he would sit for Tashahhud and remember Allah and praise and supplicate Him in his Tashahhud. Then, he would make Tasl\u012bm after the ninth Rak\u2018ah in a way loud enough for them to hear. Then, he would offer two Rak\u2018ahs while sitting, before dawn. In Had\u012bths in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections and numerous other well-known Had\u012bths, it is enjoined to make Witr the last prayer at night. An example is a Had\u012bth in which \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Make the last of your prayer at night the Witr.\" As for these two Rak\u2018ahs which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) offered after the Witr and before dawn, this was to demonstrate the permissibility of praying after the Witr, and they were not offered on a constant basis. Indeed, what he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did persistently was to observe the Witr.\nThen, she (may Allah be pleased with her) informed Sa\u2018d that these mentioned Rak\u2018ahs, the nine and the two, amount to a total of eleven Rak\u2018ahs. She addressed him by \"O young son\" by way of compassion and gentleness. She also told him that when the Prophet of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) grew old and put on weight more than he had in most of his life, he would observe Witr with seven Rak\u2018ahs and would do in the two Rak\u2018ahs as he had formerly done, i.e., he would offer them after making Tasl\u012bm from the seven Rak\u2018ahs while sitting. These seven Rak\u2018ahs along with the two Rak\u2018ahs are nine.\nThen, she informed him that when the Prophet of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) offered a prayer, he would like to offer it on a persistent basis. And if he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was prevented by sleep or illness from Qiy\u0101m al-Layl, he would perform twelve Rak\u2018ahs during the daytime, in return for the Qiy\u0101m al-Layl he missed during the night. This points out that he used to perform it on a regular and persistent basis. The Had\u012bth does not explicitly indicate that he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) missed the Witr; rather, he apparently did not miss it. He missed Qiy\u0101m al-Layl only, apart from the Witr. It also apparently indicates that he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to observe the Witr by way of precaution if he thought that he would be unable to get up for the supererogatory prayer.\nThereafter, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) informed that she was not aware that the Prophet of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) recited the whole Qur\u2019an in a night, prayed for a night till the morning, or fasted a whole month other than Ramadan. This all shows the Prophet's approach of facilitation and that he used to perform worship in accordance with his capacity and ability, by way of teaching his Ummah.\nSa\u2018d ibn Hish\u0101m said that he returned to Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) and narrated to him the Had\u012bth of \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah. Thereupon, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) \"spoke the truth\" in what she narrated to you. He also informed him that if he could visit her and talk to her, he would certainly go to her so that she would narrate this Had\u012bth to him, directly. Sa\u2018d said to Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him): \"If I had known that you would not visit her, I would not have narrated her Had\u012bth to you.\" He said that to rebuke him for refraining from visiting her and to recompense him for that by depriving him of the benefit, which would force him to visit her. The abandonment of talk with her was probably because of the dispute that took place between both of them over \u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib (may Allah be pleased with them), or because of something else.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that it was part of the Prophet's guidance to use the tooth stick upon getting up from sleep.\nIt points out the merit of \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) and her knowledge of the Prophet's conditions.\nIt includes doing justice and acknowledging the merit of those who are meritorious, as well as modesty.\nA Muslim may be honored by mentioning the merits of his father and invoking Allah's mercy upon him.\nA person should be gentle with himself and engage in worship moderately and refrain from deep engrossment in it.\nThe Had\u012bth shows the Prophet's care about the Witr prayer.\nWhen a knowledgeable person is asked about something and he knows that someone else has more knowledge about it, he is recommended to direct the questioner to him, for indeed religion is sincere advice.."}, {"number": 229, "hadith": "\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah reported:  When the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did some act, he would do it persistently, and when he slept at night or fell sick, he would offer twelve Rak\u2018ahs during the daytime. She said: I did not see the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) pray a whole night till the morning, nor did he observe fast for a whole month consecutively except that of Ramadan..", "commentary": "The Mother of the Believers \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) used to observe the Prophet's conditions day and night, as an observer and questioner. So, she became well aware of his guidance and Sunnah and taught it to those who came after her and those who asked her about his conditions (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) informs that when the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) \"did some act, he would do it persistently\" i.e., he would perfect it and do it regularly. \"and when he slept at night or fell sick\", and there was a reason preventing him from performing Qiy\u0101m al-Layl, \"he would offer twelve Rak\u2018ahs during the daytime\", i.e., he would make up for Qiy\u0101m al-Layl during the daytime, in return for the prayer he missed during the night. This points out that he used to perform it on a regular and persistent basis. She did not mention the Witr because he did not make up for it; it seems that he did not miss it. Perhaps if something arose and would prompt him to miss Qiy\u0101m al-Layl, he would hasten to observe Witr, performing it at the earlier part of the night, and delay the other prayer and make up for it during the daytime.\nThen, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) informed that it was not part of the Prophet's guidance to perform Qiy\u0101m al-Layl for the whole night; rather, he would sleep for part of the night and pray for some part of it; and that he did not fast a whole month other than the month of Ramadan, and this is because it is the month of obligatory fasting. Mentioning it is intended to negate other months, meaning that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would not fast a whole month on a voluntary basis; rather, he used to fast some days every month of the year and would not fast a whole month except for Ramadan; lest such a fast might be thought to be obligatory. This all shows the Prophet's approach of facilitation and that he used to perform worship in accordance with his capacity and ability, by way of teaching his Ummah.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that one may make up for Qiy\u0101m al-Layl during the daytime.\nIt also mentions that Qiy\u0101m al-Layl performed during the daytime is Shaf\u2018 (even-numbered).."}, {"number": 230, "hadith": "\u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Whoever sleeps and fails to recite his hizb (usual portion of the Qur'an, dhikr, or prayer), or part of it, and then recites it between the Fajr prayer and the Zhuhr prayer, it will be recorded for him as if he recited it during the night.\".", "commentary": "Out of Allah's grace towards His believing servants, He prescribed for them dispensations with which they can make up for the missed acts of worship - obligatory and voluntary.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) points out that \"Whoever sleeps and fails to recite his hizb or part of it\" at night, as established in another version narrated by An-Nas\u0101\u2019i: \"Whoever sleeps and fails to recite his hizb at night\" i.e., he is overcome by sleep or gets prevented from it by a valid reason, yet he had the intention to do it. Hizb: The portion to which a person commits himself as a habit that he engages in voluntarily, like recitation of the Qur'an, dhikr, and prayer. Allah, out of His grace, gives him plenty of time. So, if he \"recites it between the Fajr prayer and the Zhuhr prayer\" i.e., he makes up for it during this time, because this is a good length of time during which a person can compensate for what he has missed in the night. Also, this is probably intended to encourage him to do it, for this is a time connected to the latter part of the night without separation between them save for the Fajr prayer. As recompense, the full reward will be added to his record of deeds as if he has done it at its usual time. Here is a slight manifestation of Allah's gentleness towards His servant, who perpetuates a certain condition of goodness. If anything arises from him that changes this condition, Allah bestows His favor upon him and does not detract from his reward, as if he has done it by virtue of his good and sincere intention.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Urging people to make up for the missed supererogatory worship, lest they may get used to abandoning any of the act of worship altogether if they miss it\nAnd in it: The legitimacy of adopting a regular portion of worship at night\nAnd in it: The legitimacy of making up for the regular portion of worship at night if it is missed due to sleep or some other excuse."}, {"number": 231, "hadith": "Al-Q\u0101sim ash-Shayb\u0101ni related that Zayd ibn Arqam reported that he saw some people pray in the forenoon and he said: \"They definitely knew that praying at other than this hour is better, for the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: The prayer of the oft-returning to Allah is when weaned camels are bitten by excessive heat.'\".", "commentary": "The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) and the T\u0101bi\u2018is (may Allah have mercy upon them) were the keenest among people seeking the Prophet's guidance.

So, Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"They definitely knew that praying at an hour other than this one is better.\" In other words, their performance of the Duha prayer at this time is not preferred, for the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"The prayer of the oft-returning to Allah,\" i.e., those who obey Allah, glorify Him, and often turn to Him in repentance and sincerity in worship. Their prayer \"is when weaned camels are bitten by excessive heat\" i.e., when the hooves of weaned camels burn due to the extreme heat of sand caused by exposure to the sun. Weaned camels are young camels, and he singled them out because their hooves burn before the end of extreme heat, given the tenderness of the skin of their hooves. They separate from their mothers at the beginning of extreme heat, and they let them go. This happens at the latter time. So, prayer at this time is better, for people's souls are inclined to rest and comfort during this time, and this is one of the prayers whose performance is recommended to be delayed.\nIn the Had\u012bth: The merit of performing the Duha prayer at the latter time.\nAnd in it: Indicating to seize the opportunity to perform worship and engage in acts of obedience to Allah during the times of comfort, calm, and rest.."}, {"number": 232, "hadith": "Abu Mijlaz reported:  I asked Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s about Witr, and he said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say: \"One Rak\u2018ah at the end of the night.\".", "commentary": "The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) and the T\u0101bi\u2018is (may Allah have mercy upon them) were the keenest among people on seeking the Prophet's guidance.

In response to him, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) said that he heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say: \"One Rak\u2018ah at the end of the night\", i.e., its minimum is one Rak\u2018ah at the end of the night. This one Rak\u2018ah which a person offers at the end turns all the prayers he has performed during the night into Witr (odd-numbered), after they were Shaf\u2018 (even-numbered). The last part of the night is the last time to pray Witr, which is shortly before dawn. It is related in another version by Muslim: \"Indeed, prayer at the end of the night is witnessed (by the angels)\"; as the angels of mercy witness it. This prayer occurs at the time of Sahar (shortly before dawn), when Allah descends to the worldly heaven in a way that befits His majesty; and that is better.\nThere are various forms and ways of the Prophet's performance of Witr, as well as the number of its Rak\u2018ahs. Based on all of them, it becomes apparent that Witr can be one, three, five, seven, nine, or eleven Rak\u2018ahs.\nThe Had\u012bth mentions that the minimum of Witr is one Rak\u2018ah.\nIt indicates that the last time for praying Witr is the latter part of the night.\nIt also demonstrates the facilitation with regard to this prayer, as it is sufficient to observe it as one Rak\u2018ah.."}, {"number": 233, "hadith": "Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd reported: They asked the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) about the Witr (odd) prayer, and he said: \"Perform the Witr prayer before the morning.\".", "commentary": "The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) were the most keen among people to seek the Prophet's guidance and observe his circumstances, by watching and asking, so as to learn his guidance and Sunnah, including his prayer, Qiy\u0101m al-Layl, voluntary worship, and so on. And the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to teach them the obligatory and supererogatory prayers and their etiquettes and the best times for performing them. Also, he would guide them to the highest level of worship and the minimum amount of what is sufficient in it.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said that some of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) asked the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) about the Witr prayer and its time, so he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Perform the Witr prayer before the morning.\" In other words, perform the Witr prayer before the coming of the time of the obligatory prayer of the morning. Morning here refers to the true dawn. This indicates that the Witr prayer is to be performed at the end of the night prayer, and its time extends until the rise of dawn.

Abu Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah - one of the narrators - said: 'attended' i.e., attended by the angels of the night and the day.\nIn the Had\u012bth: The preferability of Witr at the end of the night\nAnd in it: Some times are more meritorious than others.\nAnd in it: Prayer at the end of the night is attended and witnessed by the angels of mercy."}, {"number": 235, "hadith": "J\u0101bir reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"The best prayer is the prolonged qun\u016bt (standing in prayer).\".", "commentary": "Prayer is the mainstay of religion, and it is the main pillar of Islam that every Muslim must fulfill without any excuse. The Prophet's comfort was provided through prayer. Therefore, he used to perform a lot of supererogatory prayers, to the extent that he would offer Qiy\u0101m al-Layl until his feet would swell due to his prolonged standing before Allah Almighty, reciting, supplicating, showing humility, and imploring Allah.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informs us that the best thing regarding prayer, in general, is the long qun\u016bt, which refers to the prolonged standing in prayer for recitation. It is explicitly mentioned in a Had\u012bth narrated by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd, in which \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn Habashi al-Khath\u2018ami (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was asked: \"Which deed is the best?\" He said: \"The prolonged standing.\" Qun\u016bt may also refer to supplication, humility, and subservience before Allah Almighty. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to do that, especially during supererogatory prayers and Qiy\u0101m al-Layl. He would pause at every verse and would not go past any verse containing a supplication without supplication with it, or a punishment without seeking the refuge of Allah Almighty from it, and so on.\nAn obligatory prayer - even if it does not include prolonged standing, recitation, and supplication - is better than a supererogatory prayer that contains such prolongation. This is because Allah Almighty ordained the obligatory prayer and fixed a certain time and a number of Rak\u2018ahs for it, and He punishes those who abandon it. It is also because it was commanded that the obligatory prayer be offered in congregation and in a brief manner, in consideration of those who are sick, those who are in need, and so on. As for the supererogatory and voluntary prayer, a person can prolong it as much as he is able to. Thus, every prayer retains its advantage and merit.\nIn the Had\u012bth: The merit of prolonged qun\u016bt and standing for recitation in prayer, along with humility and supplication."}, {"number": 236, "hadith": "J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say: \"There is an hour at night during which no Muslim man happens to be asking Allah for the goodness of this world or the Hereafter except that He will give it to him, and this occurs every night.\".", "commentary": "There are times in the night during which people's souls become peaceful, worship becomes more pleasant, and supplications are answered. Allah Almighty distinguished these times by bestowing greater bounty upon His servants during them and giving abundant goodness to those who ask for it.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) says that \"there is an hour at night\", which is a specific time. The use of the indefinite article before it denotes its significance, that it should be looked out for, and that the opportunity should be seized to catch it. It is an obscure hour like the hour on Friday. It was said: It is most likely to occur at the last third of the night, in which Allah Almighty descends to the heaven of the world, in a way that befits His majesty and does not resemble the descent of the created beings, and says, as narrated in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections: \"Who supplicates to Me so that I may respond to him?\" And it was said: The wisdom behind concealing it is to urge people to strive exceedingly to fulfill the objective all night long, not to limit the worship to a certain time to the exclusion of others, and not to lose hope for missing the advantage.\nDuring this hour, no Muslim man happens to be - and the word 'man' includes males and females - supplicating to Allah and asking for the goodness of this world and the Hereafter except that He will respond to him and grant his request. Goodness refers to all that is beneficial, on a prompt or delayed basis and in terms of religious or worldly affairs, and for which a person will not be blamed in the Hereafter.\nThe existence of this hour is constant every night, all the time. This does not particularly apply to some nights. Rather, it exists in all of them\u2014out of Allah's great bounty and abundant giving.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Urging supplication during the night, the pursuit of this hour therein, and working diligently in it.\nAnd in it: Establishing the existence of the hour of answered supplications every night.."}, {"number": 237, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to encourage the performance of Qiy\u0101m in Ramadan, without vehemently enjoining them to do so. He would say:  \"Whoever performs Qiy\u0101m during Ramadan, out of faith and in pursuit of reward from Allah, will have his past sins forgiven.\" The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) passed away while this was the case, and then it remained like that during the caliphate of Abu Bakr and the earlier part of the caliphate of \u2018Umar..", "commentary": "Ramadan is the best month, and performing Qiy\u0101m during its nights is a sublime act. So, whoever performs Qiy\u0101m during the entire Ramadan and stays awake in its nights for worship, out of desire for reward from Allah Almighty, without regarding it as burdensome or boring, will have his sins forgiven.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) informs that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to urge his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) to perform Qiy\u0101m during the nights of Ramadan. Yet, he did not enjoin them to do so by way of obliging, and he did not impose it upon them. Vehemently: denotes resolve to make something happen. He (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to say: \"Whoever performs Qiy\u0101m during Ramadan, out of faith and in pursuit of reward from Allah\" i.e., out of belief in the merit of these nights and the virtue of the good deeds performed therein, and in pursuit of Allah's pleasure and out of desire for being rewarded by Him, Exalted be He. Whoever does that, it is hoped that Allah will forgive his past sins. The recompense is expressed in the past tense in Arabic, even though the forgiveness will happen in the future, to denote certainty and assurance about its occurrence, as a favor from Allah Almighty upon His servants. Thus, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) encouraged his Ummah to do good and righteous deeds, which lead to the expiation of sins and the increase of their rewards.\nThen, Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) informed that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) passed away \"while this was the case\" i.e., the people refrained from praying behind one Im\u0101m in the Tar\u0101w\u012bh prayer. Rather, they would pray individually and separately; some would pray in the early part of the night, while others would pray in the latter part; and some would pray at home, while others would pray in the mosque, either because they were observing i\u2018tik\u0101f (retirement in the mosque) or they belonged to the people of As-Suffah, or due to some other reason. This continued to be the case throughout the caliphate of Abu Bakr and during the early phase of the caliphate of \u2018Umar. Then, \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) gathered them behind one Im\u0101m and appointed \u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b (may Allah be pleased with him) as their Im\u0101m, and he led them in congregational prayer. It continued to be performed congregationally.\n\u2018Umar's action follows the Prophet's action when he led people in this prayer once; yet he did not repeat that for fear that it might be made obligatory for them. Then, when this reason ceased to exist with the death of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and the revelation stopped, \u2018Umar held that it was more appropriate for them to offer it in a congregation as they had done during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\nThis falls under the legitimate Ijtih\u0101d (independent reasoning), for it has a basis in the religion upon which it relies and from which it stems. As for the illegitimate Bid\u2018ah (religious innovation), it has no basis in the religion or proof upon which it relies.\nThe Had\u012bth urges the performance of Qiy\u0101m during Ramadan and demonstrates its merit.\nIt shows the good understanding and judgment of \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) regarding the religious interests of Muslims, as he also displayed good judgment regarding their worldly interests.."}, {"number": 238, "hadith": "Zirr ibn Hubaysh reported:  I asked \u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b, saying: \"Your brother \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn Mas\u2018\u016bd says: 'Whoever performs Qiy\u0101m all the year long will reach Laylat al-Qadr (the Night of Decree).' He said: \"May Allah have mercy upon him. He wanted the people not to be passively reliant. Indeed, he knew that it occurs in Ramadan, that it occurs in the last ten days, and that it is the twenty-seventh night.\" Then, he swore - without exception - that it is the twenty-seventh night. I said: \"Based on what do you say that, O Abu al-Mundhir?\" He said: \"On the sign - or the mark - which the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informed us about that it (the sun) rises on that day with no rays.\".", "commentary": "Laylat al-Qadr occupies great status and significance. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) held it in high regard and commanded us to seek it and perform Qiy\u0101m al-Layl therein out of faith and in pursuit of reward from Allah. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) determined that it occurs on the odd-numbered nights within the last ten days of Ramadan and mentioned certain signs that point to it.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Zirr ibn Hubaysh relates that he asked \u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b (may Allah be pleased with him) about the statement by \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn Mas\u2018\u016bd (may Allah be pleased with him) to the effect that whoever performs Qiy\u0101m all year long will certainly reach Laylat al-Qadr on one of its nights. He did not specify this night for them. It is understood from this statement that he thought it to be an obscure night that moves throughout the year and is not limited to Ramadan.\nWhen 'Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b (may Allah be pleased with him) heard that, he supplicated so that Allah shows mercy to Ibn Mas\u2018\u016bd (may Allah be pleased with him), and that was the supplication of someone who knew the intent of the statement made by Ibn Mas\u2018\u016bd, and by way of presenting an excuse for him. Then, he explained that Ibn Mas\u2018\u016bd (may Allah be pleased with him), by his statement, intended to deter people from abandoning Qiy\u0101m al-Layl and instead waiting for Laylat al-Qadr; so, they would perform Qiy\u0101m al-Layl only on this night or neglect to perform Qiy\u0101m on the other nights of the year; and thus the wisdom behind obscurity, for which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was made to forget it, would be missed. So, he wanted to prompt the people to diligently seek this night by performing Qiy\u0101m al-Layl a lot.\nThen, 'Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b (may Allah be pleased with him) informed that Ibn Mas\u2018\u016bd (may Allah be pleased with him) was aware that it occurs in Ramadan, that it occurs within the last ten days, and that it is the twenty-seventh night. Then, \u2019Ubayy (may Allah be pleased with him) took a solemn oath, without saying thereafter: if Allah wills, \"that it is the twenty-seventh night\". \u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b (may Allah be pleased with him) assured that Laylat al-Qadr is the twenty-seventh night of Ramadan and swore emphatically about that.\nThereupon, Zirr ibn Hubaysh: What is your proof for that, O Abu al-Mundhir? This is the surname of \u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b (may Allah be pleased with him). \u2019Ubayy (may Allah be pleased with him) replied: The sign - or the mark - which the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informed us about, namely that the sun rises in the next morning of this night with no rays. Rather, it is pure and no extended rays are seen for it. So, its light spreads without rays, as the moon gives light without rays. The rays of the sun are what you see in sunlight that resembles ropes and rods coming towards you, when you look at it.\nThere is a difference of opinion over specifying Laylat al-Qadr. According to the opinion more likely to be correct, it occurs on the odd-numbered nights during the last ten days, as demonstrated by the pure Sunnah. Out of His wisdom, Allah Almighty kept it hidden from the people so that they diligently seek it within these nights, and engage in a lot of worship that brings them benefit.\nThe Had\u012bth points out that some of the Companions would adopt the approach of resolve to reach their objectives.\nIt informs that one of the signs of Laylat al-Qadr is that the sun rises in the next morning of this night with no rays.."}, {"number": 239, "hadith": "Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s reported:  I spent one night in the house of my maternal aunt Maym\u016bnah bint al-H\u0101rith.

This night was her turn with the noble Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). He said to his maternal aunt (may Allah be pleased with her): \"Awaken me when the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) stands up\" for prayer at night; out of his keenness to follow the Prophet's condition in Qiy\u0101m al-Layl.

Thereupon, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) stood up and performed ablution like that of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), as related in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections. Then, he stood on the left side of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) took hold of his hands from behind his back and made him stand on his right side.

His words \"so that I could hear his breathing while asleep\" mean that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) sat for a little while in that state and then lay down, according to the versions in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections, till Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s could hear the sound of the Prophet's breathing, which indicates deep sleep. When the time of dawn came, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) stood up and offered two short Rak\u2018ahs as the Sunnah of the Fajr prayer, without performing ablution, for the Prophet's eyes sleep but his heart does not; hence, his ablution was not invalidated, given the attentiveness of his heart. Then, he went out to the mosque and led the people in prayer, as related in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections.\nThis version narrated by Muslim is the version of Ad-Dahh\u0101k ibn \u2018Uthm\u0101n, and it contradicts the version by most prolific Had\u012bth narrators. He said: \"Then, he offered eleven Rak\u2018ahs.\" And it is reported in the version by most Had\u012bth narrators that he offered thirteen Rak\u2018ahs, and their version is the memorized one, for he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would first offer two short Rak\u2018ahs, then two long Rak\u2018ahs, then six Rak\u2018ahs, and then three Rak\u2018ahs thereafter. These amount to a total of thirteen Rak\u2018ahs.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates the permissibility of alerting a heedless person during the prayer by pulling his ear and the like.\nIt also indicates that a supererogatory prayer may be offered in the congregation.\nThe Had\u012bth points out that a boy may pass the night in the house of one of his mahrams (non-marriageable female relatives) in the presence of her husband.."}, {"number": 240, "hadith": "Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s reported:  that he spent a night in the house of his maternal aunt Maym\u016bnah.

He informs that his Shaykh \u2018Amr ibn Din\u0101r described the Prophet's ablution as short and quick. The meaning: By keeping it short, he refers to the complete washing of the body parts (without washing them more than once), which is the minimum valid ablution for prayer. In the Two Sah\u012bh Collections: \"Then, he performed a good ablution between the two ablutions\" i.e., the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) performed ablution between the short ablution and the complete one. It is more likely that he reduced the use of water while doing the washing three times. This is because he described it as good, and thus it would not be less than three times.\n\u2018Abdull\u0101h got up and did the same as the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had done, performing a short ablution and getting prepared for prayer.

Then, he performed a good ablution between the two extremes, i.e., between what is light and quick and what is deliberate and perfect. It is more probable that he minimized the use of water while washing the body parts of ablution thrice. This is because he described it as good, and so it would not be less than thrice. It is reported in the version of the Two Sah\u012bh Collections that he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) entered his house after the \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayer and went to sleep. Then, he got up and used the Siw\u0101k - a small stick made from the Arak tree - and brushed his teeth and cleansed his mouth, and then he made ablution as he recited the verses that read: {Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and earth and the alternation of the night and day are signs for people of understanding, those who remember Allah while standing, sitting, and lying on their sides, and reflect upon the creation of the heavens and earth [saying]: \"Our Lord, you have not created all this in vain. Glory be to You. Protect us from the punishment of the Fire. Our Lord, whoever You cause to enter the Fire, You have surely disgraced him, and the wrongdoers will have no helpers. Our Lord, we have heard the caller to faith calling, \u2018Believe in your Lord,\u2019 so we believed. Our Lord, forgive us our sins, expiate our misdeeds, and cause us to die among the righteous. Our Lord, give us what You have promised us through Your messengers, and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection, for You never break Your promise.\"} [Surat \u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n: 190-194] It is reported in a version by Muslim that he recited to the end of the S\u016brah.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) began to pray. Shortly thereafter, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) came and stood beside the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) after making ablution like that of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), as reported in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections. He stood on the Prophet's left side. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) held him by the hand, turned him around from behind his back, and made him stand on his right side. This points out and emphasizes how the Im\u0101m and the one who is led in prayer should stand when the congregational prayer includes two persons only, even if it is supererogatory.\nThen, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) mentioned that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) offered thirteen Rak\u2018ahs as Qiy\u0101m al-Layl, praying two Rak\u2018ahs each and then observing Witr with one Rak\u2018ah, thus completing thirteen Rak\u2018ahs.\nIn a version by Muslim: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) \"offered two Rak\u2018ahs and prolonged the standing, bowing, and prostration therein and then left\" after he finished the two Rak\u2018ahs. \"He then slept till he began to snore\" i.e., he breathed with a sound. This is an indication of deep sleep. \"Then he did that three times,\" i.e., he got up from sleep and offered two Rak\u2018ahs and then slept, until he offered in that night \"six Rak\u2018ahs. Meanwhile, he used the Siw\u0101k, performed ablution, recited those verses, and then observed Witr with three Rak'ahs,\" i.e., he concluded his prayer with Witr consisting of three Rak\u2018ahs. It was said: This version opposes the other versions of this same Had\u012bth regarding the sleep between the Rak\u2018ahs, the repetition of ablution, and the number of Rak\u2018ahs. He did not mention in other versions the sleep between the Rak\u2018ahs and the number of Rak\u2018ahs as thirteen. He probably did not include in this prayer the first two light Rak\u2018ahs with which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to commence prayer in the night, as explicitly mentioned by Had\u012bths in the Sah\u012bh Muslim Collection and others. Therefore, he said: \"He offered two Rak\u2018ahs and prolonged therein\" indicates that they came after the two light Rak\u2018ahs. So, the two light Rak\u2018ahs were followed by the two long Rak\u2018ahs, and then the six mentioned Rak\u2018ahs, and then the three Rak\u2018ahs after them, as mentioned by him; the total became thirteen Rak\u2018ahs.\nAfter the prayer, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) slept so deeply that a sound coming out with his breathing was heard. Then, his Muezzin Bil\u0101l (may Allah be pleased with him) came to tell and notify him of the Fajr prayer, as demonstrated by the versions in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came out for the Fajr prayer. The versions in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections point out that he did not renew his ablution after waking up. This is particularly reserved for the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), for his eyes would sleep but his heart would not, and so his ablution would not be broken.\nThen, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) kept supplicating in his prayer or in his prostration. And it is reported in a version by Muslim that he made this supplication while going out for the prayer, saying: \"O Allah, place light in my heart\" i.e., to enlighten it, grant it the ability to distinguish between the truth and falsehood, protect it from corrupt beliefs, and keep it away from spite, envy, and the like. \"Light in my hearing,\" is to hear what exhorts obedience to You, not disobedience. \"Light in my sight,\" is to keep it away from everything that Allah ordered us to lower our gaze from. In a version by Muslim: \"light in my tongue,\" i.e., so that it becomes keen to mention You and speak the truth and all the good deeds to be performed by the tongue. \"Light on my right, light on my left,\" i.e., on my sides, or in my body parts. \"Light in front of me, light behind me, light above me, light below me, and make light for me,\" i.e., an overall summary of these detailed items. Or he said: \"Make me light.\" By it, he meant a huge light comprising all lights; those that he mentioned here and those he did not mention. So, the light would encompass him and surround him with what preserves him from making mistakes. The intended meaning: clarifying the truth and its light and guiding to it, and that He places in every organ of these organs and in every direction of these directions a light by which he would be guided in following the truth and acting upon it, and it would guide those who want to follow the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in the true path; and so that the devil would not have a possibility of influence.\nIt was said: The light for which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked is the one that would preserve him in this world from sins and draw him closer to the performance of good deeds. It was also said: Rather, it is a light that Allah will grant him on the Day of Judgment. And it was said: It probably combines both, i.e., by the worldly light, he obtains knowledge and guidance, and by the afterlife light, he obtains illumination for the darkness on the Day of Judgment.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Mentioning some of the Prophet's peculiar characteristics.\nAnd in it: Resorting to Allah with sincere supplication\nAnd in it: A boy may pass the night in the house of one of his mahrams (non-marriageable female relatives) in the presence of her husband.\nAnd in it: Offering a supererogatory prayer in congregation."}, {"number": 242, "hadith": "Zayd ibn Kh\u0101lid al-Juhani said:  I will definitely watch the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) tonight. He offered two short Rak\u2018ahs, and then he offered two long, long, long Rak\u2018ahs. Then, he offered two Rak\u2018ahs, which were shorter than the two preceding ones. Then, he offered two Rak\u2018ahs, which were shorter than the two preceding ones. Then, he offered two Rak\u2018ahs, which were shorter than the two preceding ones. Then, he offered two Rak\u2018ahs, which were shorter than the two preceding ones. Then, he performed Witr. That was thirteen Rak\u2018ahs..", "commentary": "The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) were keen to know the Prophet's Sunnahs and guidance in all matters and to follow and comply with him in terms of his worship (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Hence, they used to ask about things hidden from them, including his guidance on Qiy\u0101m al-Layl.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Companion Zayd ibn Kh\u0101lid al-Juhani (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that he wanted to know how the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) prayed during the night. So, he said to himself: \"I will definitely watch\" i.e., I will look and observe carefully. This is an affirmation from him that he would adhere to the manner of the Prophet's performance of prayer, i.e., his prayer during the night. He would observe the number of its Rak\u2018ahs and how long he would stand therein. In the version by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd: \"I rested my head on his threshold, or Fust\u0101t (tent)\" i.e., he treated it as a pillow. \"Fust\u0101t\": a large tent made of hair. The word 'tent' indicates that he was on a journey, for the Prophet's houses were not tents. So, Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him) informed that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) offered two short Rak\u2018ahs, in which he did not stand or recite for long. With such two Rak\u2018ahs, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to commence Qiy\u0101m al-Layl, as their shortness activates the body. Then, \"he offered two long, long, long Rak\u2018ahs,\" He said it three times to point to their great length. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) offered eight Rak\u2018ahs, with every two Rak\u2018ahs being shorter than the two Rak\u2018ahs that preceded them. Then, he concluded his prayer with one Rak\u2018ah. It is reported from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) that Witr can be one, three, or five Rak\u2018ahs and so on. The number of Rak\u2018ahs performed by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) at that time was thirteen, which is the maximum reported about the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). The minimum reported about him (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) is seven Rak\u2018ahs.\nPrayer in the night starts after the \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayer and extends to shortly before dawn. One is not required to sleep before performing it.\nThe Had\u012bth demonstrates the Prophet's diligence in worship and prayer, and how this teaches the Ummah to engage in worship diligently and not to neglect it.."}, {"number": 243, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h reported:  I was with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) on a journey and we reached a Mashra\u2018ah (water passage from the river). He said: \"O J\u0101bir, will you not engage in Ishr\u0101\u2018 (drinking water)?\" I said: 'Yes.' He said: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) then got down and I drank. He said: Then, he went away to relieve himself, and I placed for him water for ablution. He said: Then, he came back and performed ablution, and then stood and prayed in one garment, having its ends tied from the opposite sides. I stood behind him and he caught hold of my ear and made me stand to his right side..", "commentary": "This Had\u012bth demonstrates some of the Prophet's actions during travel, including his clemency towards travelers and riding animals, and points out how the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) performed prayer on some of his journeys. J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) says: \"I was with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) on a journey and we reached a Mashra\u2018ah\" i.e., a path for crossing the water from the bank of a river, sea, or the like. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"O J\u0101bir, will you not engage in Ishr\u0101\u2018?\" Ishr\u0101\u2018 is to drink with the mouth directly or by taking a handful of water without the use of any tool, like a cup. Taking water with the mouth mostly happens in the case of animals, and people may also drink in this way or take water in their hands. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) urges him to come to the Mashra\u2018ah and take what he needs of water, drink from it, and water his animals. This shows the Prophet's leniency towards people and animals during travel, so that they can rest, drink, and water their mounts. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) got off his mount, and J\u0101bir drank and watered his mount. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went to a remote place to answer the call of nature, urinating and defecating. Meanwhile, J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) prepared water for him for purification and ablution. When the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) relieved himself, he came and performed ablution. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) stood up and prayed in one garment, \"having its ends tied from the opposite sides\" i.e., he took the end of the garment which he dropped over his right shoulder from underneath his left hand, and its end which he dropped over his left shoulder from underneath his right hand. Then, he tied them over his chest so as to hold the garment and prevent it from falling.\nThen, J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) came and stood for prayer behind the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) held J\u0101bir from the tip of his ear, dragged him, and made him stand to his right side. This is how the Im\u0101m and the one praying with him should stand when only two persons engage in a congregational prayer, be it obligatory or supererogatory.\nThe Had\u012bth mentions praying in one garment.\nIt demonstrates how the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used to serve the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).."}, {"number": 244, "hadith": "\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah reported: When the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) got up in the night to pray, he would commence his prayer with two light Rak\u2018ahs..", "commentary": "Qiy\u0101m al-Layl is the source of honor for the believer. So, a Muslim should be keen to pray in the night, following the Prophet's example. The Prophet's prayer at night was constant, and he would engage in prayer until his feet would swell, in gratitude towards Allah and praise for His blessings.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Mother of the Believers \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) relates that when the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) got up at night to pray, he would start his prayer with two light Rak\u2018ahs, in preparation for the prolonged prayer, whose Rak\u2018ahs were described by \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) in these words: \"and do not ask about their beauty and length,\" as reported in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections.

It is the best prayer after the obligatory prayers. The pure Shariah encourages its performance and demonstrates its great reward and virtue.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) demonstrates part of the understanding related to Qiy\u0101m al-Layl. He informs that when someone wants to perform Qiy\u0101m al-Layl, he should commence his prayer with two short Rak\u2018ahs. This is to break the desire for sleep, and their shortness is more suitable for repelling it, given the successive movements involved therein. Moreover, if he offers long Rak\u2018ahs at the beginning, this will be heavy for his body, and he will probably reduce his Rak\u2018ahs of Qiy\u0101m al-Layl, due to the heaviness he feels. But if he is gradual in prolonging the prayer, he may become more active and desire to increase the prayer and make it longer, after this gradation. This is because he has prepared his body and activated it with these two Rak\u2018ahs. It is said: Starting Qiy\u0101m al-Layl with two short Rak\u2018ahs serves to initiate loosening the knots that the devil ties on a person's head after he sleeps, and these knots are completely loosened when the prayer is completed.."}, {"number": 246, "hadith": "Abu Salamah ibn \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n ibn \u2018Awf reported: I asked \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah, the Mother of the Believers, (may Allah be pleased with her): \"With what did the Prophet of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) use to commence his prayer when he got up at night.

Verily, You guide whom You will to the straight path)..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to pray at night as much as Allah willed him to pray, and he adopted certain Sunnahs and ethics in his house. The T\u0101bi\u2018is were keen to know his worship in detail and would ask about the acts of worship the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to perform at home so that they could follow his guidance and adhere to his Sunnah.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Abu Salamah ibn \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n ibn \u2018Awf asked \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah, the Mother of the Believers: With what words or deeds did the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) use to commence his prayer when he got up at night? In other words, how would he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commence the prayer? In response, she told him that when he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) got up at night, he would commence his prayer with this supplication: \"O Allah, Lord of Gabriel, Michael, and Israfil,\" i.e., I supplicate to You, my Lord, and the Lord of all that is great, such as those great angels, and You are Greater than them and than all Your creation. It befits You to answer supplications. Those particular angels are singled out due to their great status. Gabriel is the angel entrusted with revelation, and Michael is the angel in charge of rains, plants, and provisions, and he occupies a great status and high rank and is honorable in the sight of Allah Almighty. He has assistants who apply what he commands them with the order of his Almighty Lord. And Isr\u0101f\u012bl is the angel entrusted with blowing the Trumpet at the command of his Lord, the blow of panic and swooning, and the blow for standing before the Lord of the worlds.\nIf a person knows the status of the angels, those great and noble creatures, and knows their traits, he will know the greatness of their Creator, Exalted be He, and His great power and dominion. Indeed, the greatness of a created being stems from the greatness of the Creator. He will also give thanks to Him for His care about His servants, as He entrusted some of those angels with preserving them, supplicating for Allah's forgiveness for them, and recording their deeds. Also, he who knows the angels and genuinely believes in them and will love them for what they do, as they worship Allah Almighty and obey Him in the perfect manner, and they ask for Allah's forgiveness for the believers, supporting them, and so on.\n\"Originator of the heavens and the earth,\" i.e., their Creator and Maker. \"Knower of the unseen and the seen,\" i.e., I supplicate to You, O Knower of the unseen and the seen, for You know what is hidden from Your servants and what is apparent and visible to them. \"You judge,\" i.e., You judge with reward and punishment. \"on the Day of Judgment between Your slaves concerning that over which they used to differ\" regarding the matter of religion in this worldly life. You punish the sinners, if You will, and reward the obedient ones. People differed after they had been following the Fitrah of Islam (natural disposition), and then the prophets and messengers came to guide them. They differed over the path of guidance and the straight path with which they came, and that is the truth from their Lord.\n\"Guide me, by Your permission, to the truth about which people differed,\" i.e., make me steadfast and increase me in guidance to the straight path which the prophets and messengers called to, by Your help and facilitation. \"Verily, You guide whom You will to the straight path,\" which is the path of the truth that has no crookedness in it. This is the religion of Islam with which Allah sent Muhammad (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and it was called 'path' because it leads to the destination just as a real path does. This phrase serves as a reason for asking Him for guidance, i.e., because You guide whomever You will. This supplication represents complete humbleness before Allah Almighty.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Clarifying the dhikr with which Qiy\u0101m al-Layl is commenced\nAnd in it: Pointing out that a person should ask Allah Almighty to guide him to the true path\nAnd in it: Clarifying that guidance lies in the Hand of Allah Almighty; none can grant it except Him, Exalted be He."}, {"number": 247, "hadith": "\u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib reported: When the Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) got up to pray, he would say: \"I have turned my face to the One Who created the heavens and the earth, in exclusive devotion, and I am not one of the polytheists.

The Prophet's Companions were keen to know his worship in detail, so that they could follow his guidance and adhere to his Sunnah.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that when the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) got up to offer the obligatory or supererogatory prayer, he would supplicate to Allah Almighty with what is known as the opening supplication, which lies between the Takb\u012br of Ihr\u0101m (Takb\u012br at the start of prayer) and the recitation of Surat al-F\u0101tihah. He (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to say in his supplication: \"I have turned my face,\" i.e., I sincerely devoted my worship to Allah Who \"created the heavens and the earth,\" i.e., He originated their creation without a precedent example. In all this, I am Han\u012bf (upright, exclusively devoted), turning away from Shirk (polytheism) towards Tawh\u012bd (monotheism). Among the Arabs, a Han\u012bf person would refer to one who followed the religion of Abraham (Ibr\u0101h\u012bm) (peace be upon him), and this is Islam. Then, he further demonstrated and clarified the meaning of Han\u012bf, saying: \"and I am not one of the polytheists.\" I do not associate anything as a partner with Allah, and I am not one of those described as polytheists. The word polytheist is used to refer to every disbeliever, including idol worshipers, Jews, Christians, Magians, and others.\nThen, he supplicated, saying: \"Verily, my prayer\" which I perform. Prayer is a comprehensive term that refers to Takb\u012br, recitation, bowing, prostration, Tashahhud, and others. \"my Nusuk\", which is worship. Nas\u012bkah is everything that brings closeness to Allah Almighty, and it is used to refer to sacrifice by which one draws close to Allah Almighty. A N\u0101sik is one who sincerely devotes his worship to Allah Almighty. Also, \"my life and my death are for Allah,\" for He is the One Who created and predestined them, or He is the Possessor and Disposer of them. No one else has any control over them. And it was said: The righteous acts in life and the good things that follow death, like a will or managing affairs, or the worship I perform during my life and the condition in which I die, are sincerely devoted to the Countenance of Allah. \"the Lord of the worlds,\" for He is the One Who possesses them, raises them, and reforms and manages their affairs. There is no partner with Him in His dominion. And I have been commanded regarding all of this - to embrace complete Tawh\u012bd (monotheism) that comprises sincerity in words and beliefs. And I am one of the Muslims who submit to Allah's command, yield to Him in obedience, and acknowledge all these attributes of Allah Almighty. This is an affirmation of the meanings of Tawh\u012bd and acceptance of the religion of Allah Almighty.\nThen, he praised Allah Almighty, acknowledged his own sin, and asked Him for forgiveness, saying: \"O Allah, You are the Sovereign,\" i.e., the real Owner of all creatures. \"and I am Your slave,\" acknowledging that You are my Owner and the Disposer of my affairs, and Your judgment regarding me is surely executed. \"I have wronged myself and I have admitted my sin,\" i.e., I have wronged myself by falling short in fulfilling Your rights, and I have admitted this shortcoming. \"so, forgive all my sins,\" i.e., O Lord, pardon my shortcomings. \"for no one forgives sins but You.\" This is an admission and acknowledgment of the attribute of forgiveness for Allah alone. In this, he acknowledged his shortcomings and mentioned that before asking for forgiveness, out of politeness, as Adam and Eve (peace be upon both of them) said: {Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves; if You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be among the losers.} [Surat al-A\u2018r\u0101f: 23]\nThen, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Guide me to the best of morals,\" i.e., direct me to the most perfect and most excellent morals, enable me to adopt them, and make me steadfast upon them. \"for none can guide to them but You.\" Guidance lies in Your Hand alone. The hearts of people are between two of the Fingers of the Most Compassionate, and He overturns them as He wishes. \"and turn away from me the worst of morals,\" i.e., keep me away from ugly and reprehensible manners. \"for none can deliver me from them but You.\" This is an acknowledgment that Allah Almighty alone is the One Who can repel the Divine Decree and keep the worst of them from His servants.\nThen, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Here I am, in answer to Your call,\" i.e., I persist in obedience to You and compliance with Your command in a repeated manner. \"in support of Your command,\" i.e., supporting Your command one time after another and following Your religion one time after another. \"All goodness lies in Your Hands\". This is an acknowledgment that all goodness that reaches the servants or hoped to reach them does actually lie in the Hands of Allah, Exalted be He. \"and evil does not stem from You\". Evil is not attributed to You. Or evil is not committed to attain closeness to You. Or evil does not ascend to You. Rather, it is good speech that ascends. Then, he said: \"I exist by You and I turn to You,\" i.e., my success is through You, and I take refuge in You and belong to You; or I exist by You creating me and my return is to You; or upon You I rely, and to You I turn for refuge.\n\"Blessed and Exalted are You.\" This is praise for Allah Almighty involving two things: The first is 'Blessed'; this is because Allah Almighty is the Most Worthy of blessing. The word 'blessed' means: Your favors are plentiful, overwhelming, and reachable to all creation. Indeed, the blessing is plentiful and enduring favors and goodness. The second is 'Exalted'; it comes from exaltedness in essence and attributes. Indeed, Allah Almighty is Exalted by His essence and by His attributes. He is Exalted by His essence above all creation, and His exaltedness is an innate, timeless, and eternal attribute. Then, he said: \"I seek Your forgiveness and repent to You,\" i.e., I ask You to forgive me and eliminate my sins. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to open his prayer with this great supplication.\nAnd when he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) bowed, he would say in his Ruk\u016b\u2018: \"O Allah, it is for You that I bowed.\" You alone, and I do not bow to any human being or any of Your creation. \"it is in You that I believed\" in Your sacred essence, excellent names, and sublime attributes. \"and it is to You that I submitted,\" i.e., I humbled myself and surrendered, or I turned my face to You in sincere devotion. \"Humbled,\" i.e., obedient and surrendered to You \"are my hearing, my eyesight.\" He singled them out from among all senses because most evils are committed by them. When we humble ourselves, the insinuations decrease. Also, humbled to You are \"my brain, my bones, and my sinew.\" Sinew: it connects and ties the joints with the bones. They are more delicate than bones.\nWhen he rose from bowing and said, \"Allah hears whoever praises Him,\" he would say thereafter: \"O Allah, our Lord, praise is due to You, (praise) that fills the heavens and the earth, that fills what exists between them, and that fills anything You desire afterward.\" It means: I turn to You, O Allah, with complete praise that befits Your blessings and favors, as many as You will. This is meant for the quantity of numbers. If praise were material objects, then due to You is praise that fills the heavens and the earth, that fills what exists between them. It was said: This refers to the scrolls in which praises are recorded. \"and that fills anything You desire afterward,\" i.e., that fills what is beyond the heavens and the earth, as You will, which is not known to the people. This is intended for teaching the Prophet's Ummah, for Allah Almighty already forgave his past and future sins.\nThen, when he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) prostrated himself, he would say during his prostration: \"O Allah, it is to You that I prostrated myself, it is in You that I believed, and it is to You that I submitted. My face has prostrated to the One Who created it,\" i.e., it yielded, humbled itself, and submitted to Allah Almighty. He singled out the face from among all the body parts used in prostration because it is the noblest among them, as Allah Almighty is the One Who shaped it and split open its faculties of hearing and seeing. So, the One Who created this face, put in it features by which it is identified, and split open in it eyes and ears and gave them discernment through seeing and hearing is the One worthy of worship, prostration, and submission. \"Blessed is Allah\": Extolled, Glorified, and Exalted far above, for He is the Creator Who alone brought everything out of nothing into existence and gave His creation the best shape, and He, Exalted be He, is \"the best of all creators,\" who fashion and give due proportions.\n\"Then\", after he finished bowing and prostration,\" one of the last things he would say between the Tashahhud and Tasl\u012bm is: \"O Allah, forgive my past\" sins, \"and my future\" deeds. It was said: What I did before the Prophethood and what I did thereafter. It was also said: The future things in Your knowledge which You predestined for me. And it was said: It means: If a sin is committed by me in the future, make it connected to Your forgiveness. Indeed, the pursuit of forgiveness before the commission of sins aims at forgiving a sin if it is committed. \"my hidden and apparent sins,\" i.e., forgive all my sins, for they are: either past or future, and hidden or apparent; and forgive me. \"my transgression\" when I exceed the bounds. \"and the sins that You know of more than I do\": My sins which I do not know, in terms of their number and rulings. \"You are the One Who puts forward and the One Who holds back\": No one can put forward what You hold back or hold back what You put forward. \"There is no god but You\": No one is truly worthy of worship except You, Exalted be You. We are not capable of enumerating the praise of You. You are as You have praised Yourself. So, he concluded with this praise of Allah Almighty, which is the word of Tawh\u012bd and the word of sincere devotion.\nThis is a Had\u012bth that comprises a lot of ath-kaar that are to be said in some positions in prayer, namely the commencement, bowing, and prostration.\nIn the Had\u012bth: It was part of the Prophet's guidance to say the opening supplication.\nAnd in it: The dhikr to be said during bowing, prostration, and after rising from bowing, and the supplication before Tasl\u012bm.\nAnd in it: teaching politeness in extending praise to Allah Almighty, that we should ascribe to Him only the good things, not the bad ones, out of politeness.."}, {"number": 248, "hadith": "Hudhayfah reported: I prayed with the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) once at night and he started reciting Surat al-Baqarah. I thought that he would bow in Ruk\u016b\u2018 at the end of one hundred verses, but he continued. I thought that he would probably recite it (the Surah) in one Rak\u2018ah, but he continued. I thought he would perhaps bow in Ruk\u016b\u2018 on completing (this Surah). He then started reciting Surat an-Nis\u0101\u2019 and read it all, and then he started reciting Surat \u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n and read it all. He was reciting slowly; when he came across a verse containing Tasb\u012bh (glorifying Allah), he would glorify, and when he came across asking, he would ask, and when he came across seeking refuge, he would seek refuge. Then, he bowed in Ruk\u016b\u2018 and said: \"Subh\u0101n rabbiya al-\u2018azh\u012bm\" (Glory be to my Lord, the Most Majestic). His bowing lasted nearly the same length of time as his standing. Upon rising from Ruk\u016b\u2018, he said: \"Sami\u2018a Allahu liman hamidah\" (Allah hears whoever praises Him). He then remained standing nearly the same length of time as he had spent bowing. He then prostrated and said: \"Subh\u0101n rabbiya al-a\u2018la\" (Glory be to my Lord, the Most High), and his prostration lasted nearly the same length of time as his standing. Another version adds: \"Sami\u2018a Allahu liman hamidah; rabbana laka al-hamd\" (Allah listens to he who praises Him; praise be to You, Our Lord)..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) liked standing before his Lord, and so he used to prolong the prayer and perfect it by long recitation, bowing, prostration, and supplication. His prayer was also marked by humility, submissiveness, and subservience before Allah Almighty.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Hudhayfah ibn al-Yam\u0101n (may Allah be pleased with him) says that he performed Qiy\u0101m al-Layl one night with the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). He said that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) started his recitation after Surat al-F\u0101tihah with Surat al-Baqarah. Hudhayfah thought that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would bow after reciting one hundred verses, but he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went past one hundred verses. So, Hudhayfah thought that he would probably recite Surat al-Baqarah in one Rak\u2018ah, but he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) continued the recitation after finishing Surat al-Baqarah and started reciting Surat an-Nis\u0101\u2019 and read it all. Then, he started reciting Surat \u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n and read it all. This stems from his prolongation of the prayer and the excellence of recitation in Qiy\u0101m al-Layl. This prolongation and this manner in this prayer was probably done by him at a time that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) happened to particularly enjoy what he was up to and was so engrossed therein away from anything else. This accords with his statement in the agreed-upon Had\u012bth: \"If any of you leads the people in prayer, let him shorten it, because among them are the weak, the sick, and the elderly people. And if any of you prays alone, let him prolong as much as he wishes.\"\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was \"reciting slowly,\" i.e., unhurriedly, and deliberately. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would glorify Allah, by saying \"Suh\u0101n Allah\", when he came across a verse containing Tasb\u012bh. And when he came across a verse that urges the asking of Allah Almighty, he would ask of Him. In a version by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd: \"And he did not come across a verse of mercy except that he would pause at it and make supplication.\" \"and when he came across [a verse] seeking refuge,\" as the verse mentions Hellfire or contains a threat, \"he would seek refuge\" with Allah and resort to Him for salvation from His punishment. This all adds to the length of the prayer.\nAfter all that, he bowed in Ruk\u016b\u2018. \"and he said: 'Subh\u0101n rabbiya al-\u2018azh\u012bm' (Glory be to my Lord, the Most Majestic).\" He adopted this wording in Tasb\u012bh, and it means: We glorify Allah Almighty and praise Him for His greatness. This is an exaltation of Allah Who possesses this attribute. \"His bowing lasted about the same length of time as his standing,\" i.e., the duration of bowing. He stayed therein for nearly the same length of time he had spent standing. Then, he rose from bowing and said: \"Sami\u2018a Allahu liman hamidah\" (Allah hears whoever praises Him). This is an informative sentence in the sense of a supplication. In other words: O Allah, answer the supplication of he who praises You. Another version adds: \"Rabbana laka al-hamd\" (praise be to You, Our Lord). This is one of the best supplications and forms of gratitude to Allah Almighty.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) remained standing nearly the same length of time as he had spent in bowing - before descending to prostrate. \"He then prostrated and said: 'Subh\u0101n rabbiya al-a\u2018la' (Glory be to my Lord, the Most High).\" He reserved this dhikr and praise for prostration, and it means: Glorifying the Almighty Sovereign and exalting Him above any imperfection. This is the exaltation of Allah Who possesses the attribute of exaltedness.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Demonstrating how the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) performed Qiy\u0101m al-Layl in terms of the length of the prayer and recitation and the prolongation of bowing, prostration, and standing.\nAnd in it: Considering the meanings of the verses and pausing to make supplications in accordance with their content, during the prayer.."}, {"number": 249, "hadith": "J\u0101bir reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"When one of you performs the prayer in his mosque, he should leave a portion of his prayer for his house, for indeed Allah puts goodness in his house on account of his prayer.\".", "commentary": "Prayer is of great significance in the life of a Muslim. So, he should regularly perform it and fulfill its Sunnahs and pillars in the required manner, and he should perform a lot of voluntary prayers, for they compensate for any shortcomings in the obligatory ones. He should also keep a portion of goodness for his house by offering supererogatory prayers therein.\nThis Had\u012bth contains Prophetic guidance and education, as the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) instructed us: When a Muslim performs the obligatory prayer in the mosque, \"he should leave a portion of his prayer for his house,\" i.e., he should offer some of them in his house. This refers to supererogatory prayers. This is because prayer at home is more hidden and farther away from show-off, and so that the house may be blessed on account of that, and mercy and angels descend in it, and the devil runs away from it. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informed that Allah puts goodness in the house of this performer of supererogatory prayers on account of his prayers; this goodness encompasses his wife and children and brings blessing to their sustenance and life spans and an increase in their guidance and piety, and the house is filled with dhikr and worship, and the angels descend to supplicate for the inhabitants of the house and ask for Allah's forgiveness for them.."}, {"number": 250, "hadith": "Abu M\u016bsa reported: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"The house in which Allah is mentioned and the house in which Allah is not mentioned are like the living and the dead.\".", "commentary": "In the mentioning of Allah lies the life and vigor of people's souls, and in its abandonment lies slackness, idleness, and lethargy. The houses of Muslims should be protected against the devil, be filled with light, and blessing. This can be achieved by performing acts of worship therein, like dhikr, prayer, supplication, and so on.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) holds a comparison between two types of houses, to make the matter easier to understand. One type is a house where Allah is mentioned, and the other is a house where Allah is not mentioned. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) points out that the house where Allah is mentioned is \"like the living,\" i.e., a sound and healthy person, as his inner being shines with Im\u0101n (faith) and his outward appearance is adorned with the light of worship. People love him, and they seek support and benefit from him. On the other hand, the house where Allah is not mentioned is like the dead, i.e., like a corpse. No one approaches it, and there is no good in it or use of it. Its inside is false, and its outside is defective.\nThe meaning of this Had\u012bth can be an example for houses and those who live therein. The houses where Allah is mentioned abound with a life of Im\u0101n, blessing, and goodness for their inhabitants. By contrast, the houses where Allah is not mentioned are desolate like graves, and their inhabitants only go to them for sleep, which is a minor death. They are devoid of goodness and blessing, even if what appears to people is contrary to that.\nAlso, the meaning may appropriately apply to the inhabitants of houses, namely human beings. Whoever mentions Allah, his heart becomes alive and the impact of that manifests in him. Thus, he becomes useful in this world and the Hereafter. As for a person who does not mention Allah, his heart is lifeless and devoid of Im\u0101n and the effects of an Im\u0101n-oriented life. He is like a dead person whose deeds come to a halt and cannot obtain any good from his worldly life. This is supported by the version by Al-Bukh\u0101ri: \"The one who mentions Allah and the one who does not mention Allah are like the living and the dead.\"\nIn the Had\u012bth: Urging remembrance of Allah Almighty at home, and that our houses should not be devoid of it."}, {"number": 251, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Do not turn your houses into graves. Indeed, Satan runs away from the house in which Surat al-Baqarah is recited.\".", "commentary": "The houses of Muslims should be protected against the devil, filled with light, and blessing. This can be achieved by performing acts of worship therein, like dhikr, prayer, supplication, recitation of the Qur'an, and so on. Recitation of the Qur'an brings goodness and blessing to the place where it takes place, for the Qur'an is the extended rope of Allah, which contains tranquility of the soul and expels the devils from the houses where it is recited, particularly Surat al-Baqarah.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) says: \"Do not turn your houses into graves,\" i.e., do not make them similar to the graves, devoid of dhikr and worship, and allocate for them a share of the recitation of the Qur'an and prayer. It is narrated in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections that Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Perform some of your prayers in your houses, and do not turn them into graves.\"\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) pointed out that the devil flees and runs away from the house where Surat al-Baqarah is recited, because he despairs of alluring the inhabitants of that house due to the blessing of this Surah, or because he sees their seriousness and diligence regarding religion and worship. When the Qur'an in general is recited in a house, it becomes spacious for its inhabitants, its blessings increase, it gets frequented by the angels, and the devils are expelled from it. On the other hand, when the Qur'an is not recited in a house, it becomes straitened for its inhabitants, its blessings decrease, the angels run away from it, and the devils visit it.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates the merit of Surat al-Baqarah and its superiority to other Surahs, and it is indeed superior, for it combines Shar\u2018i rulings more than any other Surah of the Qur'an. It contains the characteristics of the believers, the traits of the hypocrites, an explanation of the stories of the Children of Israel, the forbiddance of sorcery and usury, and mentions of the Qiblah, prayer, fasting, Hajj, \u2018Umrah, divorce, waiting periods, debts, conditions, mortgage, and legal retribution, as well as other rulings.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Urging recitation of the Qur'an and a lot of dhikr in the houses\nAnd in it: Informing people that the Qur'an and dhikr make houses and hearts alive and populated.."}, {"number": 252, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"When one of you gets up to pray at night and the Qur'an becomes difficult for his tongue, and he is unaware of what he is reciting, he should lie down.\".", "commentary": "Qiy\u0101m al-Layl is the source of honor for the believer, and it has great merit. Hence, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) urged its regular observance and that a person should engage in it while in a state of activeness and vigor, for this is more beneficial and appropriate.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) mentions that when a Muslim gets up to perform a supererogatory prayer or recite the Qur'an during the night, \"and the Qur'an becomes difficult for his tongue,\" i.e., it becomes hard for his tongue, and he cannot recite it in a correct manner that accurately conveys its words and meanings, due to heavy sleepiness, to the extent that he is not aware of what he is reciting from the Qur'an, and he will probably fall into some distortion or error. If this happens, he should go to sleep and not pray or recite the Qur'an while in this condition. He should take a rest until his vigor is restored to him.\nSo, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) urged his Ummah to perform acts of worship that do not put them in hardship, while acceptance of their worship lies with Allah. This comes from Allah's mercy towards the Muslim Ummah, as He removed undue restrictions and difficulties from them in their worship, and He wanted ease for them, not hardship. Allah Almighty says: {Allah wants ease for you and does not want hardship for you.} [Surat al-Baqarah: 185] Allah Almighty also says: {Allah does not burden any soul greater than it can bear.} [Surat al-Baqarah: 286]\nIn the Had\u012bth: Urging us to come to prayer while in a state of humility, focus, and activeness."}, {"number": 253, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Would any one of you, when he returns to his family, like to find three large, fat, and pregnant she-camels?\" We said: 'Yes.' He said: \"Three verses that one of you recites in his prayer are better for him than three large, fat, and pregnant she-camels.\".", "commentary": "Recitation of the Qur'an brings goodness and blessing, for it is the extended rope of Allah, and it affords tranquility of the soul and abundance of rewards, and it leads to salvation on the Day of Judgment. If the recitation is in prayer, the merit becomes greater and the reward more abundant.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked his Companions: \"Would any one of you like, when he returns to his family,\" i.e., when he returns home, where his wife and children are, to find in their place or house \"three pregnant she-camels?\" A \"khalifah\" is a pregnant she-camel. It used to be one of the most precious properties among the Arabs. and 'large' and 'fat'. If a she-camel is also large and fat, it becomes even dearer. They replied to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in the affirmative, by the necessity of nature and looking forward to the reward. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informed them that reciting three verses in prayer is better than the three pregnant she-camels. The reward for the recitation of three verses in prayer is better and more meritorious than the reward for possessing those she-camels. This is because the recitation of three verses belongs to the enduring good things that are beneficial in the Hereafter, whereas the she-camels are among the supplementary and transient things in the world. He mentioned three verses because this is the minimum number to form a plural number. Yet, this matter is not limited to reciting three verses only. Rather, the more verses a worshiper recites in his prayer, the greater the reward he will get in proportion to their number.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Urging recitation of the Qur'an in prayer."}, {"number": 254, "hadith": "\u2018Uqbah ibn \u2018\u0100mir reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came out while we were in As-Suffah and asked:  \"Which of you would like to go out every morning to But'h\u0101n or Al-\u2018Aq\u012bq and bring two large-humped she-camels without being guilty of sin or severing ties of kinship?\" We replied: \"O Messenger of Allah, we would like that.\" He said: \"Does not one of you go out in the morning to the mosque and learn or recite two verses of the Book of Allah Almighty? That is better for him than two she-camels, and three verses are better for him than three she-camels, and four verses are better for him than four she-camels, and so on.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to teach his Companions the merit of the noble Qur'an and demonstrate the reward for learning, teaching, and reciting it.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Uqbah ibn \u2018\u0100mir (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came to them while they were sitting in As-Suffah, a shaded area in the Prophet's Mosque, where the poor Muh\u0101jir\u016bn (Immigrants) used to take refuge. He asked them: \"Which of you would like to go out every morning to But'h\u0101n\", a place near Mad\u012bnah that stretches from its south to its west, \"or to Al-\u2018Aq\u012bq\", a valley in Mad\u012bnah whose water gathers from Al-\u2018Aq\u012bq area, which is located more than 100km to the south of Mad\u012bnah and it stretches to its outskirts. He mentioned But'h\u0101n and Al-\u2018Aq\u012bq in particular because they were the closest places to Mad\u012bnah where camel markets were held. \"and bring two large-humped she-camels\"; he mentioned such camels as an example because they are among the most precious property to the Arabs; and that he will gain the two she-camels without being guilty of sin such as stealing or severing kinship ties with them? The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) replied that they would like and love that. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to those who want to obtain this goodness: \"Does not any of you go out in the morning to the mosque\", going there early, \"and learn or recite two verses of the Book of Allah Almighty? That is better for him than two she-camels\" i.e., the goodness that stems from learning two verses or reciting them is better in the sight of Allah than obtaining two she-camels and the benefit to be gained through them. Likewise, three verses are better than three she-camels, and four verses are better than four she-camels. His words \"and so on\" mean that if he learns or recites more verses, he will get what is better than the same number of she-camels. This indicates that learning the Qur'an is better than the pursuit of wealth, as a general rule; and this is more so when a person has a lot of free time.\nThe Had\u012bth points out the merit of seeking knowledge and the merit of learning the Qur'an.\nIt demonstrates how the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to preach to his Companions and guide them. Leaders should learn from this and follow the Prophet's example in dealing with their subjects.."}, {"number": 255, "hadith": "Abu \u2019Um\u0101mah al-B\u0101hili reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) say: \"Recite the Qur'an, for it will come as an intercessor on the Day of Judgment for its reciters. Recite the two illuminating ones: Surat al-Baqarah and Surat \u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n, for they will come as if they were two clouds, two shades, or two flocks of birds in ranks defending their reciters.

And he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) says that the Qur'an will be embodied in a form seen by the people on the Day of Judgment, as Allah will give people's deeds a form and weight so that they will be placed on the scale. The Qur'an will intercede for those who recite and act upon it and plead for them before Allah Almighty, seeking forgiveness for them and that they be saved from Hellfire and admitted into Paradise, or that their ranks in Paradise be elevated.\nHe repeated the word 'recite' to urge the recitation of certain Surahs and to emphasize their special merit regarding intercession. His words are: \"the two illuminating ones\" refer to Surat al-Baqarah and Surat \u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n which were called as such because they are two lights, or because of the abundance of the lights of the Shar\u2018i rulings and the excellent names therein. Undoubtedly, the light of the speech of Allah is greater and brighter, and each Surah in the Qur'an is an illuminating one, given the rulings and admonitions contained in it and because it provides healing for the chests, illumination for the hearts, and multiplication of the rewards for its reciters. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) singled out the recitation of Surat al-Baqarah and Surat \u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n to demonstrate their high status and affirm their special merit regarding intercession for those who persistently recite them and act upon what they contain. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) pointed out that they will be embodied and take a specific form and appear as if they were \"two clouds\" that will shade their companion from the heat of this situation of standing. Clouds are given this name because they cloud and conceal the sky. \"or two shades.\" A \"ghay\u0101yah\" or shade is anything that provides a person with a cover above his head, like a cloud and so on. \"or two flocks,\" i.e., two groups or parties, \"of birds in ranks.\" This is a flock of birds extending their wings and being linked to one another. The intended meaning is that they will protect their receiver from the heat of this situation of standing and the distress of the Day of Judgment. Also, they will push against Hellfire and its keepers, or plead for intercession for him, or when he is questioned, when his tongue does not speak, his lips are sealed, and his arguments are lost.\nHis words: \"Reciting Surat al-Baqarah\" constitutes a specification in addition to the previous specification. He first mentioned the Qur'an as a whole, and then singled out the two illuminating Surahs, and then singled out Surat al-Baqarah from both of them. This indicates its high status and great merit. He said: \"for taking it\" - by persistently reciting it, pondering its meanings, and acting upon what it contains - \"is a blessing,\" i.e., increase, growth, and a great benefit for its reciter. \"abandoning it is regret,\" i.e., deploring and feeling sorrowful over the missed reward. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informed that \"the Batalah,\" i.e., the sorcerers, cannot overcome it. This means that they cannot recite it because of their deviation from the truth and engrossment in falsehood; or that they cannot repel it and penetrate its protection for he who recites and memorizes it, as it shields its reciter and memorizer from magic. It was said: The \"Batalah\" refers to idle and lethargic people, for they cannot memorize or recite it due to its length, whereas they are prone to laziness. Another version uses 'and' not 'or': \"and as if they were two shades, and as if they were two flocks of birds in ranks.\" Reconciling the two versions, the 'or' in the first version is not used for doubt, giving choices in likening the two Surahs, or hesitation. Rather, it is for diversification and division of the reciters, for a group of them will see the two Surahs as two clouds, another group will see them as two shades, and another group as two flocks of birds stretching out their wings.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Urging the recitation of the Qur'an, the merit of Surat al-Baqarah and Surat \u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n, and the significance of Surat al-Baqarah in particular.."}, {"number": 256, "hadith": "An-Naww\u0101s ibn Sam\u2018\u0101n al-Kil\u0101bi reported: I heard the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say: \"The Qur'an and its people who used to act upon it will be brought forth on the Day of Judgment, preceded by Surat al-Baqarah and Surat \u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) likened them to three things, which I did not forget afterward. He said: \"As if they were two clouds, or two black canopies with 'sharq' (light) between them, or as if they were two flocks of birds in ranks pleading for their companion.\".", "commentary": "Recitation of the Qur'an brings goodness and blessing for those who recite it and act upon it, for it is the extended rope of Allah, and it leads to salvation on the Day of Judgment, particularly Surat al-Baqarah and Surat \u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n, given their great status.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informs us that \"The Qur'an and its people who used to act upon it will be brought forth,\" i.e., those who recite the Qur'an, have faith in its information and believe it, and act upon its rulings. The Qur'an will be an argument for those people on the Day of Judgment. Excluded from this are those who do not believe in its information or establish its limits; the Qur'an will be an argument against them. This is because the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said in a Had\u012bth narrated by Muslim: \"The Qur'an is an argument for you or against you.\" This is supported by the verse that reads: {This is a blessed Book that We have sent down to you [O Prophet] so that they may reflect upon its verses, and so that people of understanding may take heed.} [Surat S\u0101d: 29]\nAnd by the Prophet's words: \"preceded by Surat al-Baqarah and Surat \u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n,\" i.e., they come ahead of the Qur'an. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) likened Surat al-Baqarah and Surat \u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n to three things, saying: \"As if they were two clouds\"; in Arabic \"Ghamamat\u0101n\", which means two clouds or two white clouds. A cloud is called such because it clouds the sky and conceals it. \"or two canopies,\" i.e., two clouds that shade their companion from the heat of this situation of standing. He described these two clouds as 'black' because they are thick and piled upon each other. \"with 'sharq' between them,\" i.e., light. The light of 'sharq' is the sun. This indicates that they, albeit thick, do not conceal light. It was said: Sharq means rift, i.e., a gap and break between them. This is like separating every two Surahs in the Mus'haf (copy of the Qur'an) with Basmalah (mentioning Allah's name). \"or as if they were two flocks,\" i.e., two herds or two groups. \"of birds in ranks,\" i.e., extending their wings and being linked to one another. The intended meaning is that they will protect their reciter from the heat of this situation of standing and the distress of the Day of Judgment. 'pleading' i.e., pushing against Hellfire and its keepers or pleading for him in intercession or when he is questioned, when his tongue keeps silent, his lips are distraught, and his arguments are lost. Their companion means: He who acts upon them and what they contain, of rulings and legislations, whether he is a memorizer or a reciter of them.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Urging the recitation of the Qur'an and acting upon it; and the merit of Surat al-Baqarah and Surat \u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n.."}, {"number": 257, "hadith": "Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s reported: As Gabriel (Jibr\u012bl) was sitting in the presence of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), he heard a creak from above. So, he raised his head and said: \"That is a gate in the heavens that was opened today; it had never been opened before today.\" An angel descended from it. He said: \"That is an angel that descended to earth; he had never descended before this day.\" He gave the greeting of peace and said: \"Have glad tidings with two lights that have been given to you, which none of the prophets were given before you: Surat al-F\u0101tihah and the concluding verses of Surat al-Baqarah. You will not read one letter of them except that you will be given it.\".", "commentary": "What a great religion Islam is! And how great its numerous glad tidings which Allah Almighty gave to His Prophet Muhammad (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his Ummah are. He, Exalted be He, revealed to him the Reminder, the Qur'an, and made its recitation greatly rewardable; each letter is credited with one good deed, and the virtuous deeds are multiplied. And He, Exalted be He, endowed some Surahs and verses with an additional merit for those who recite them, to urge and encourage their recitation.\nIn this Had\u012bth a divine gift is mentioned for those who recite Surat al-F\u0101tihah and the concluding verses of Surat al-Baqarah. \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that Gabriel (peace be upon him), the angel in charge of the revelation, was sitting in the presence of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). In the version by An-Nas\u0101\u2019i: \"As the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was sitting and Gabriel (peace be upon him) was with him.\" This means that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) told his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), including Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him), about Gabriel (peace be upon him) sitting with him. \"he heard\" refers to Gabriel (peace be upon him), and it is also probable the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was the one who \"heard a creak from above,\" i.e., in heaven. A creak is a sound released because of the movement of something. Gabriel (peace be upon him) - or the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) - raised his head to look at the source of this sound. Gabriel (peace be upon him) said that this is a gate in the heaven of the world, which was opened today and had never been opened except today; and an angel descended from it to the earth, and he had never descended before today. This is all to prepare for something great. Indeed, the opening of one of the gates of the heaven for the first time and the descent of an angel other than Gabriel to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) for the first time points to the significance of the matter for which he was sent. When the angel descended, he greeted the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and said to him: \"Have glad tidings\" - glad tidings are only given about good things - \"with two lights that have been given to you, which none of the prophets were given before you: Surat al-F\u0101tihah and the concluding verses of Surat al-Baqarah,\" i.e., their special reward of their recitation was not given beforehand; otherwise, the entire Qur'an was not given to any prophet before him. Surat al-F\u0101tihah was endowed with this particular merit because it summarizes all the meanings of Im\u0101n (faith), Islam, and Ihs\u0101n (excellence). It comprises the fundamentals of the Fiqhi rules and knowledge principles. And the concluding verses of Surat al-Baqarah, beginning from {The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, as do the believers...} to the end of the Surah, are endowed with this particular merit because they contain praise for the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). This is because they comply with their content and submit to their meanings and for their supplication to Allah Almighty and return to Him in all their affairs; and also, because those verses contain the response to their supplications after they were taught to them and they said them, and so He made things easier for them and forgave and supported them.\nThen, the angel said: \"You will not read one letter of them except that you will be given it.\" This stems from the great bounty of Allah towards His Prophet and his Ummah. He called them two lights because the recitation of each verse in them brings light to the reciter that illuminates his way and leads him to the right path and the true course, given the sublime meanings contained therein, which include acknowledgment of the Lordship and absolute resort to Allah with the great supplication using their words.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Demonstrating the great status of Surat al-F\u0101tihah and the concluding verses of Surat al-Baqarah and urging their recitation.\nAnd in it: Pointing out that there are angel messengers to the prophets other than Gabriel\nAnd in it: Showing the honorable status of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) with his Lord, as He honored him with such things that He did not honor the previous prophets with, giving him these two lights\nAnd in it: Affirming the existence of the gates of heaven, that they are opened and closed, and that some angels do not descend to earth except for such glad tidings."}, {"number": 258, "hadith": "Abu ad-Dard\u0101\u2019 (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Whoever memorizes ten verses from the beginning of Surat al-Kahf will be guarded against the Dajj\u0101l (Anti-Christ).\".", "commentary": "Recitation of the Qur\u2019an brings goodness and blessing for those who recite it, as it is the extended rope of Allah, causing tranquility of the soul and an abundance of rewards, and it protects a servant from the distresses and trials of worldly life and the horrors and hardships on the Day of Judgment.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) says that whoever memorizes ten verses from the beginning of Surat al-Kahf, Allah will guard, protect, and preserve him from the trial of the Dajj\u0101l, who will emerge at the end of time and claim to be God. The Dajj\u0101l originally refers to someone who often engages in lying and deception. His emergence is one of the major signs of the Day of Judgment, and his trial is the gravest on earth from the creation of Adam to the coming of the Hour, as Allah Almighty will enable him to perform some miracles whereby he will mislead his followers. Verily, the memorization of these verses is a cause of protection against the Dajj\u0101l. It was said: This is due to the wonders and miracles existing in these verses. So, whoever knows them will not wonder at the matter of the Dajj\u0101l or be misled by him; and he will patiently endure the trials of the Dajj\u0101l and his apparent bliss and punishment; or that the protection from the Dajj\u0101l is granted by Allah to those who memorize these verses.\nAlso, there are means of protection against the trial of the Dajj\u0101l, which are not mentioned in this Had\u012bth, but are authentically reported from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in other Had\u012bths: Knowing the names and attributes of Allah, which makes one know that the Dajj\u0101l is a human being who eats and drinks, and Allah is far Exalted above that; the Dajj\u0101l is one-eyed, whereas Allah is not one-eyed; and no one sees his Lord until he dies, whereas the people, including the believers and disbelievers, will see the Dajj\u0101l when he emerges. It also includes the pursuit of Allah's refuge from the trial of the Dajj\u0101l, particularly in prayer, as reported in a Had\u012bth by \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to supplicate in prayer: \"O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the punishment of the grave, and I seek refuge with You from the trial of the Dajj\u0101l.\" And it also includes fleeing and turning away from the Dajj\u0101l, for those who will be present at his time, given the suspicions and amazing supernatural incidents that appear with him and by which a person might be tempted.\nIn the Had\u012bth: The merit of the ten verses at the beginning of Surat al-Kahf.\nAnd in it: Clarifying that the trial of the Dajj\u0101l is so severe that protection against him is needed."}, {"number": 259, "hadith": "\u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"O Abu al-Mundhir, do you know which verse of Allah's Book that you have is the greatest?\" I said: \"Allah and His Messenger know best.\" He said: \"O Abu al-Mundhir, do you know which verse of Allah's Book that you have is the greatest?\" I said: {Allah: none has the right to be worshiped except Him, the Ever-Living, All-Sustaining} [Surat al-Baqarah: 255]. Thereupon, he struck me on the chest and said: \"May knowledge be pleasant for you, O Abu al-Mundhir!\".", "commentary": "The glorious Qur'an is the strong rope of Allah and His straight path. Its recitation brings goodness and blessing and affords tranquility of the soul and abundance of reward. Allah endowed some of its Surahs and verses with a special merit.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) one day asked him: \"O Abu al-Mundhir\", a surname for \u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b (may Allah be pleased with him). \"Do you know which verse of Allah's Book that you have is the greatest?\" i.e., in terms of the reward and benefit for its reciter in this world and the Hereafter. \u2019Ubayy (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"I said: Allah and His Messenger know best.\" This stems from the Companions' politeness towards the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). It was said: \u2019Ubayy knew which verse was the greatest when the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked him about it, but he did not reply out of respect, modesty, and politeness towards him (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). If he had answered him the first time he asked him, he would have thus displayed his knowledge. He also probably did not give the answer because he expected that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would probably tell him that another verse is greater than that or inform him of some other benefit. When the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) repeated the question, he knew that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) wanted him to answer and wanted to test his memorization and information. Thereupon, he answered him that the greatest verse - as far as he knew - is the one that reads: {Allah: none has the right to be worshiped except Him, the Ever-Living, All-Sustaining. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth. Who is there that can intercede with Him except with His permission? He knows what was before them and what will be after them, while they encompass nothing of His knowledge, except what He wills. His Kurs\u012b [footstool] extends over the heavens and earth, and safeguarding of both does not weary Him, for He is the Most High, the Most Great.} [Surat al-Baqarah: 255] It is called the verse of Kurs\u012b. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) approved his answer and accepted it as correct, and he struck with his honorable hand on the chest of \u2019Ubayy (may Allah be pleased with him). This behavior on the Prophet's part was done by way of gentleness, given his approval and acceptance of this answer and his admiration of the answerer. He said to him: \"May knowledge be pleasant for you, O Abu al-Mundhir,\" i.e., may knowledge be blissful for you. This is meant as a supplication for him to find knowledge easily and be versed therein.\nThe verse of Kurs\u012b is the greatest verse in the Qur'an because it combines such fundamental divine names and attributes that are not combined in any other verse. In it, Allah Almighty describes Himself as the worshiped God other than Whom none is truly worthy of worship. He alone is worthy of worship, out of love and exaltation for Him, given the perfection of His attributes. To Him belongs the complete life, which was not preceded by non-existence, will not be followed by an end, and entails all attributes of perfection. He is Self-Sustaining and does not need anyone, and He undertakes the affairs of His creation, including sustenance and other things. All creatures stand in need of Him and cannot exist without Him. His support of their existence entails all actions of perfection. Part of the perfection of His life and sustainability is that He does not suffer drowsiness or get overcome by sleep, and He is the sole Possessor of all that is in the universe. No one dares to intercede with Him unless He gives him permission. He is the One Who knows all the affairs of His creation; past, present, and future, and all else do not possess anything of Allah's knowledge whatsoever except what He taught them, by His will. His Kurs\u012b - the place of His feet - encompassed the heavens and the earth, despite their vastness and greatness, and their preservation is not heavy or hard for Him; rather, this is something easy and simple for Him, Exalted be He. He is the Possessor of absolute exaltedness above all His creation. He is Exalted by His Essence above His Throne and High above His creation by His absolute power and perfect attributes. He is the Possessor of absolute greatness in His Essence, attributes, and authority, and all other than Him are humble before Him and so little next to Him. Nothing is greater than Him, Exalted, Glorified, and Blessed be He.\nIn the Had\u012bth: A great merit for \u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b (may Allah be pleased with him).\nAnd in it: Praising a person to his face, if it serves a good purpose and if self-admiration is not feared, and so on\nAnd in it: The knowledgeable person's great respect for his virtuous companions."}, {"number": 260, "hadith": "Abu ad-Dard\u0101\u2019 reported: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Is any of you incapable of reciting a third of the Qur'an in a night?\" They said: \"How does one recite a third of the Qur'an? He said: \"{Say: 'He is Allah, the One} equals a third of the Qur'an.\".", "commentary": "Recitation of the Qur'an brings goodness and blessing, as it is the strong rope of Allah, and it affords tranquility of the soul and abundant reward. Allah Almighty has particularly endowed Surat al-Ikhl\u0101s with great merit.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asks his Companions, by way of teaching them: \"Is any of you incapable of reciting a third of the Qur'an in a night?\" Since this is hard to do, the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) wondered and asked him (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): How does one recite one-third of the Qur'an in a night?! In response to them, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said that the recitation of Surat al-Ikhl\u0101s {Say: 'He is Allah, the One} equals the recitation of one-third of the Qur'an. So, its reciter obtains the reward for reciting a third of the Qur'an. And it is equal to one-third of the Qur'an based on the consideration of its meanings, as the Qur'an contains rulings, information, and Tawh\u012bd (monotheism), and knowing the names and attributes of Allah Almighty falls under Tawh\u012bd. And this Surah comprises the third category (Tawh\u012bd); so, it equals one-third based on this consideration. In a version of the Sah\u012bh Muslim Collection, it reads: \"Indeed, Allah divided the Qur'an into three parts, and He made {Say: 'He is Allah, the One'} one of the parts of the Qur'an.\" This is because it contains two of Allah's names, which comprise all the attributes of perfection, and they do not exist in any other Surah of the Qur'an. These two names are: \"Al-Ahad\" (the One) and \"As-Samad\" (the Eternal Refuge). They point to the Essence of Allah that possesses all the attributes of perfection. To explain that: \"The One\" gives a feeling about His particular existence, which none shares with Him, and \"the Eternal Refuge\" gives a feeling about all the attributes of perfection, for He is the One Whose sovereignty reached the pinnacle of sublimity and perfection, and all creatures need Him, whereas He, Exalted be He, does not need anyone.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Demonstrating the merit of Surat al-Ikhl\u0101s\nAnd in it: The vast bounty of Allah Almighty towards His servants, as He made the recitation of a short Surah equivalent to one-third of the Qur'an."}, {"number": 261, "hadith": "Abu ad-Dard\u0101\u2019 reported: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"Indeed, Allah divided the Qur'an into three parts, and He made Surat {Say: 'He is Allah, the One'} as one of the parts of the Qur'an.\".", "commentary": "The glorious Qur'an is the strong rope of Allah and His straight path.

Allah endowed some of its Surahs and verses with a special merit.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informs that Allah Almighty divided the Qur'an into three parts, i.e., sections: One section comprises the stories of the past people, another section contains the Shar\u2018i (legal) rulings, and the third section includes the belief in Allah's oneness and mention of His attributes. \"and He made Surat {Say: 'He is Allah, the One'} as one of the parts of the Qur'an\", which are three. This is the section of Tawh\u012bd and the mention of Allah's attributes. It is because this Surah includes two of the names of Allah Almighty which comprise all the traits of perfection, and they do not occur in any other Surah of the Qur'an. They are: Al-Ahad (the One) and As-Samad (the Eternal Refuge). They point to the Essence of Allah which possesses all the attributes of perfection. This is clarified by the fact that \"the One\" gives a feeling about His particular existence, which no one else shares with Him; and \"the Eternal Refuge\" gives a feeling about all the attributes of perfection. This is because He is the One Whose sovereignty reached the pinnacle of sublimity and perfection, and the One before Whom all creatures stand in need and Who does not need anyone, Exalted be He. Since this Surah comprises knowledge of the attributes of perfection, it came to be regarded as one-third compared to the complete knowledge of the attributes of Allah's Essence and the attributes of His actions. It is said: It means that the reward for reciting Surat al-Ikhl\u0101s gets multiplied until it becomes tantamount to the reward for reciting one-third of the noble Qur'an.\nThe Had\u012bth points out the merit of Surat al-Ikhl\u0101s.."}, {"number": 262, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Gather together, for I will recite to you one-third of the Qur'an.\" So, there gathered those who gathered. Then, the Prophet of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came out and recited {Say: \"He is Allah, the One\"}. Then, he went back in. We said to one another: \"I think this is a revelation that came to him from heaven. That is why he went in.\" Then, the Prophet of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came out and said: \"Indeed, I said to you that I would recite to you one-third of the Qur'an, and it is indeed equal to one-third of the Qur'an.\".", "commentary": "Surat al-Ikhl\u0101s is a great surah despite its few words, as it contains great and sublime meanings. In it, the meaning of Tawh\u012bd (monotheism) for Allah is refined, worship is solely devoted to Him, and refuge is sought with Him alone, and the son and father are negated from Him, Exalted be He. This is one of the fundamental topics to which the Qur'an refers.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to his Companions: 'Gather together' i.e., come together. This command indicates that he will inform them about something important, namely that he will really recite to them one-third of the Qur'an, or what equals its third in terms of the meaning and reward. So, there gathered those who gathered from among the people. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came out and recited to them Surat al-Ikhl\u0101s only: {Say: \"He is Allah, the One\"}. Then, he entered his room. When they saw that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) recited nothing but this Surah and did not recite one-third of the Qur'an in terms of the amount and the number of verses, they thought that he entered because the revelation was coming down to him and that he would thereafter come out and recite to them the rest of the third of the Qur'an. Then, when the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came out, it was as if the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) knew what they were thinking about and that they were waiting to hear from him the rest of the third of the Qur'an. So, he informed them that Surat al-Ikhl\u0101s equals one-third of the Qur'an in terms of the reward. Thus, its reciter obtains the reward for reciting a third of the Qur'an. And it is equal to one-third of the Qur'an based on the consideration of its meanings, as the Qur'an contains rulings, information, and Tawh\u012bd, and knowing the names and attributes of Allah Almighty falls under Tawh\u012bd.

They are: {Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of the daybreak} and {Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind.}\".", "commentary": "What a great religion Islam is! And how great its numerous glad tidings which Allah Almighty gave to His Prophet Muhammad (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his Ummah are. He, Exalted be He, revealed to him the Reminder, the Qur'an, and made its recitation greatly rewardable; each letter is credited with one good deed, and the virtuous deeds are multiplied. And He, Exalted be He, endowed some Surahs and verses with an additional merit for those who recite them, to urge and encourage their recitation.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Uqbah ibn \u2018\u0100mir (may Allah be pleased with him) says that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Have you not seen that some verses were revealed tonight the like of which has never been seen before?!\" This is an exclamatory question, as the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) wondered at the great merit of these verses, the like of whose meanings and blessings were not revealed in other Surahs to him before. Then, he identified those verses, saying that they are the two Surahs: \"{Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of the daybreak} and {Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind.}\" They are the two refuge-seeking Surahs. They mention the pursuit of refuge, resorting, and asking for protection from Allah, the Lord of creation and the Lord of mankind. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used these two Surahs in seeking refuge with Allah Almighty and performing Ruqyah (faith healing) for himself.\nSurat al-Falaq contains the verses that read: {Say: \"I seek refuge with the Lord of the daybreak, from the harm of all what He has created; from the harm of the darkening night when it spreads around, from the harm of the sorceresses who blow on knots, and from the harm of the envier when he envies.\"} The meaning is: Say, O you, the Messenger\u2014I resort to the Lord of the Morning. The Surah begins by describing the One with whom refuge is sought as the Lord of the Daybreak, for this is the time for the outpouring of lights and the descent of goodness and blessings. I seek refuge in this Lord, Who possesses this description, from what is harmful among the creatures. He solely attributes to the One with Whom refuge is sought what He created. He begins with the general words: {from the harm of all what He has created}, i.e., from the evil of His creation, the evil committed by the accountable servants in the form of sins and mutual harm among themselves, and what is done by unaccountable creatures of animals, such as the predatory beasts and insects, by eating, nipping, stinging, and biting, and the different kinds of harm Allah caused to exist in other than animals, like burning in the fire and killing by poison.\nThen, He follows it with that whose harm is more hidden in terms of time, and it is the opposite of the break of the day, namely the coming of darkness, with His words: {from the harm of darkening [night] when it spreads around.} This is because harm spreads more easily at this time and getting rid of it becomes more difficult.\nHe particularly mentions the time in which wickedness is hidden, like the sorceresses who blow on knots and the enviers, and He links the envier with the conditional {when he envies}, because when an envier displays his envy, his evil and harm becomes more effective. Allah combines the evils in this Surah and concludes them with envy, so that it should be known that it is the meanest trait.\nAnd Surat an-Nis is the verses that reads: {Say: \"I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind, the Sovereign of mankind, the God of mankind, from the harm of the lurking whisperer, who whispers into the hearts of mankind, from among jinn and mankind.\"} [Surat an-N\u0101s: 1-6] The meaning: Say - O you the Messenger -: I resort to the Lord of mankind and seek refuge in Him. He is the Sovereign of mankind and does whatever He wills to them. There is no other sovereign for them but Him and no true deity for them but Him. I seek refuge in Him from the evil of the devil who throws his whisperings to man if he fails to remember Allah and he goes backwards if he remembers Him. He throws his whisperings into the hearts of people. Such a whisperer could be among humankind and jinns alike.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Demonstrating the great significance of the two refuge-seeking Surahs\nAnd in it: Pointing out that there is nothing in the Qur\u2019an like the two refuge-seeking Surahs in terms of the meanings, blessings, and pursuit of Allah's refuge through them."}, {"number": 264, "hadith": "\u2018\u0100mir ibn W\u0101thila reported: N\u0101fi\u2018 ibn \u2018Abdul-H\u0101rith met \u2018Umar at \u2018Usf\u0101n, and \u2018Umar had employed him as a governor of Makkah. He said: \"Whom have you appointed as a governor over the people of the valley?\" He said: \"Ibn Abza.\" He said: \"Who is Ibn Abza?\" He said: \"He is one of our freed slaves.\" He said: \"Have you appointed a freed slave as a governor over them?!\" He said: \"He is a reciter of the Book of Allah Almighty and he is knowledgeable about the laws of inheritance.\" \u2018Umar said: \"Indeed, your Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: Indeed, Allah elevates by this Book some people and degrades others.'\".", "commentary": "The Commander of the Faithful \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b (may Allah be pleased with him) was keen that the rulings of Islam should be applied in all corners of the state. Therefore, he used to ask the governors about their conditions and how they acted in different situations, correcting their errors and holding them accountable for them. He would put in a high status the knowledgeable people of the Qur'an, the Sunnah, and the Shar\u2018i rulings, in compliance with the principles of the honorable Shariah.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018\u0100mir ibn W\u0101thila (may Allah be pleased with him) says that the Companion N\u0101fi\u2018 ibn \u2018Abd al-H\u0101rith (may Allah be pleased with him), was one of those who embraced Islam at the time of the Conquest of Makkah and was approved by \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) during his caliphate as a ruler and governor of Makkah, and stayed there until he died. N\u0101fi\u2018 met \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b (may Allah be pleased with him), who stopped at \u2018Usf\u0101n on the way to Hajj. He called him for a meeting, and he met him in \u2018Usf\u0101n, a village 80km north of Makkah on the way to Mad\u012bnah. When they met, \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) asked him: Whom have you appointed as a governor over the people of Makkah in your place for the period of your absence as you meet the Commander of the Faithful? The valley here refers to the valley of Makkah and T\u0101\u2019if. He informed him that he had appointed Abdur-Rahm\u0101n ibn Abza (may Allah be pleased with him), as a governor over them, a freed slave of N\u0101fi\u2018 ibn al-H\u0101rith. He embraced Islam during the Prophet's lifetime and lived in Kufa. \u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib (may Allah be pleased with him) appointed him as a governor of Khorasan.\n\u2018Umar said to him, disapprovingly: \"Have you appointed a freed slave as a governor over them?!\" i.e., have you appointed a freed slave as a governor over the people of Makkah, the people of the Sacred City, and the people of nobility and high status?! It was said: \u2018Umar's disapproval of his appointment as a governor over them was not because he belittled or disdained him, but because of the non-fulfillment of the purpose behind such an appointment, namely to set people's affairs in order and manage them, which requires the governor appointed over them to be a man of awe, greatness, and noble status in the hearts of the general public. To this end, he should be free and of noble descent and high standing; otherwise, people would disrespect and disobey him. Thus, the objective of such a post would fail.\nClarifying the reason behind appointing him over them, Nafi\u2018(may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"He is a reciter of the Book of Allah Almighty,\" i.e., he is a memorizer of it and knowledgeable about its rulings. \"And he is knowledgeable about the laws of inheritance,\" i.e., about the division of inheritance according to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). In other words, Allah Almighty elevated this governor over them by virtue of these things, and they know him to be like that, so they would respect and revere him and obey his command; thus, their affairs would be set aright, and their conditions would become stable. Hence, \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), liked what he heard about the traits of Ibn Abza and approved the action of Nafi\u2018 ibn al-H\u0101rith (may Allah be pleased with him), and thereupon said: \"Indeed, your Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: Indeed, Allah elevates by this Book\" the noble Qur'an \"some people.\" Allah elevates those who believe in it, recite it, and sincerely act according to it. He elevates them in this world, by making them lead a good life, and in the Hereafter, by making them among the people of high ranks along with those upon whom Allah bestowed His favor. \"and degrades others,\", lowering their status; those are the people who do not believe in it, or believe in it yet neglect it and abandon its application. So, He causes them to live in misery and straits in this world and makes them the lowest of the low in the Hereafter.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Putting a freed slave in authority over free people if he is knowledgeable about the laws of inheritance\nAnd in it: Knowledge and the Qur'an redress the deficiency in one's lineage\nAnd in it: The merit of knowledge\nAnd in it: The approach of \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) as he used to follow up on his governors and observe how they ruled their subjects, lest they might neglect their rights, and thus, he would be the one to blame, for he was the chief caretaker.\nAnd in it: The merit and honor of the knowledge of inheritance, for it is the knowledge to which Allah Almighty gave high status, as He Himself undertook the division of inheritance in His glorious Book and did not leave it to anyone.."}, {"number": 265, "hadith": "\u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b reported: As I was in the mosque, a man entered, prayed, and recited in a manner that I found to be strange. Afterward, a man entered and recited in a manner different from the other. When we finished the prayer, we all went to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and I said: \"This man recited in a manner that I found to be strange, and another man entered and recited in a manner different from his recitation.\" The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanded them to recite, and when they did so, he expressed approval of both. This made me inclined to disbelieve in him, even to an extent I had never reached in J\u0101hiliyyah (the pre-Islamic period of ignorance). When the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) noticed how I was affected, he gave me a pat on the chest. Thereupon, I broke into a sweat and was filled with fear as though I were looking at Allah Almighty. He said to me: \"O \u2019Ubayy, a message was sent to me: Recite the Qur'an in one mode, but I replied to Him: Make matters easy for my Ummah. So, He sent me the second message: Recite it in two modes. I replied to Him: Make matters easy for my Ummah. So, He sent me the third message: Recite it in seven modes. And you may ask Me for something in return for each reply I sent to you. I said: O Allah, forgive my Ummah; O Allah, forgive my Ummah. And I delayed the third request until the Day when all humankind, even including Abraham (Ibr\u0101h\u012bm) (peace be upon him), will seek my intercession. [In a version]: \u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b told me that he was sitting in the mosque when a man entered, prayed, and recited in a manner... and he related a similar Had\u012bth..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to teach his Companions the Qur'an to perfection, and he would recite it to them in modes and manners that suited various dialects, all of which belong to Arabic, to make things easy and simple for the Muslims.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that he was sitting in the Prophet's Mosque, and the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was not present at the time - and \u2019Ubayy (may Allah be pleased with him) was one of the memorizers of the Book of Allah Almighty - as a man entered and prayed. \u2019Ubayy (may Allah be pleased with him) heard him recite the Qur'an in a way he found to be strange, i.e., \u2019Ubayy (may Allah be pleased with him) did not know this way of recitation and did not hear it from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Then, another man entered and recited in a way different from the recitation of the earlier man. When they all finished the prayer, they went to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in one of his rooms. \u2019Ubayy (may Allah be pleased with him) said to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): This man recited in a way I found to be strange, as his recitation differed from that of mine. And another man entered and recited in a way different from the recitation of the earlier one. So, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ordered both men to recite so that he could hear their recitation and make sure whether it was correct or wrong. The two men recited, and he expressed approval of the recitation of both and said that both were good, or he said to each of them: You have done well. When \u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b (may Allah be pleased with him) heard the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) express approval of their recitation, he thought about denying the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and felt confused and surprised in a way he could not describe and the like of which he had not experienced during J\u0101hiliyyah, when he was in misguidance and disbelief, which are worthier of this kind of denial. J\u0101hiliyyah: It is the period during which people were polytheists before the Prophet's mission, and it was called as such because of the prevalence of their ignorance.\nWhen the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) perceived that \u2019Ubayy (may Allah be pleased with him) experienced the whisperings and promptings of Satan, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) struck him with his noble hand on his chest, to reassure him. As a result, sweat flowed from all over the body of \u2019Ubayy (may Allah be pleased with him), as if he were looking at Allah out of fear and embarrassment about the devil's whispering that influenced him. This indicates that it was a prompting from the devil, which disappeared immediately after the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) struck with his hand on \u2019Ubayy's chest, and the sweat overflowed from him.\nAt this point, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informed \u2019Ubayy - by way of reassuring him and making things clear to him - that Allah Almighty revealed to him that he should recite the Qur'an in one mode, i.e., in one way. \"but I replied to Him,\" i.e., to Allah Almighty through Gabriel (Jibr\u012bl) (peace be upon him), the angel in charge of the revelation. \"Make matters easy,\" i.e., he asked Him, Exalted be He, to make the recitation of the Qur'an simple and easy for the Muslim Ummah. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was going back to his Almighty Lord to ask Him to facilitate things for his Ummah, as he is reported to have done regarding prayer. Allah Almighty replied to His Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) on the second time: \"Recite it in two modes,\" and on the third time Allah facilitated the matter for the Ummah by its recitation in seven modes. In other words, the Qur'an was revealed in seven ways or seven dialects, intended to make the matter simple and easy. It was said: The Qur'an was first revealed in the language of the Quraysh tribe and the surrounding eloquent Arabs. Then, it was made permissible for the Arabs to recite it in their own languages which they habitually used, along with their different words and rules of parsing. He did not oblige any of them to shift from their language to another because it involved difficulty. This was also for their tribalism and their need for facilitation, so that they could understand the intended meanings. This mentioned permissibility was not granted based on personal inclinations such that everyone could change any word to its equivalent in his language. Rather, the criterion in this regard was to hear it from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\nThen, the Almighty Lord said to His Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): \"In return for each reply I sent to you,\" i.e., in return for each time you came back to Me to ask for facilitation and ease for your Ummah and I replied to you, \"you may ask Me for something,\" i.e., an answered supplication, which you should make, and you will not be disappointed or rejected regarding it. Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"O Allah, forgive my Ummah; O Allah, forgive my Ummah\" twice. And the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) delayed the third request until the Day of Judgment. It is the Grand Intercession. All humankind will need his intercession, when everyone will say \"myself, myself,\" even Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him).\nIn the Had\u012bth: Allah's facilitation of things for the Ummah and His mercy towards them\nAnd in it: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) is the best among the prophets and all humankind.\nAnd in it: The superiority of Abraham (peace be upon him) over all the other prophets, except for our Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him)\nAnd in it: The Prophet's compassion towards his Ummah\nAnd in it: It shows how much the Companions cared about the Qur'an, defended it, and preserved it and its words as they had heard it, without deviation from it.\nAnd in it: Pointing out that the Qur'an was revealed in seven modes\nAnd in it: Pardoning people for the devil's promptings and not holding them accountable for them\nAnd in it: Showing the noble status of Ubayy (may Allah be pleased with him), for the devil did not gain control over him and so he could not allure him as he allured many others who were predestined by Allah to suffer misery by persisting in denial. Rather, Allah Almighty inspired him to repent through the Prophet's striking on his chest and his supplication for him.\nAnd in it: Establishing the intercession for the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him)."}, {"number": 266, "hadith": "\u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b reported:  The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was by a pond belonging to Banu Ghif\u0101r when Jibr\u012bl (Gabriel) (peace be upon him) came to him and said: \"Allah Commands you to make your Ummah recite the Qur'an in one letter.\" He said: \"I ask Allah for His protection and forgiveness, verily, my Ummah cannot bear that.\" He then came to him for the second time and said: \"Allah commands you to make your Ummah recite the Qur'an in two letters.\" He (the Prophet) said: \"I ask Allah for His protection and forgiveness, verily, my Ummah cannot bear that.\" Then, he came to him for the third time and said: \"Allah commands you to make your Ummah recite the Qur'an in three letters.\" He (the Prophet) said: \"I ask Allah for His protection and forgiveness, verily, my Ummah cannot bear that.\" Then, he came to him for the fourth time and said: \"Allah commands you to make your Ummah recite the Qur'an in seven letters, and in whichever letter they recite, they will be right.\".", "commentary": "The Noble Qur\u2019an is the speech of Allah Almighty revealed to His Prophet Muhammad (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Allah has made its recitation easy for people so that they reflect upon its verses. A form of this facilitation and flexibility is that Allah has permitted its recitation in seven letters and in Qir\u0101\u2019\u0101t (modes of recitation) that He taught to His Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), who taught them to his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), who reported these Qir\u0101\u2019at to those who succeeded them.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2019Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b (may Allah be pleased with him) reports that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was by \"Ad\u0101\u2019ah (pond) belonging to Banu Ghif\u0101r.\" Ad\u0101\u2019ah: still water. It is said that it is a place in Makkah, as Ghif\u0101r was a tribe from Kin\u0101nah, and their location was near Makkah. It is also said that it is a place in Mad\u012bnah attributed to Banu Ghif\u0101r because they settled therein.\nGabriel (peace be upon him) - the angel entrusted with the revelation - came to him and said: \"Allah Almighty commands you to recite the Qur'an to your Ummah,\" referring to the Ummah that responded to his call, \"in one letter,\" i.e. in one manner. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"I ask Allah for His protection and forgiveness,\" i.e. I ask Allah Almighty for His ease, facilitation, and forgiveness for them. The Prophet's request for forgiveness was out of fear of negligence committed on their side regarding how they must recite. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Verily, my Ummah cannot bear that,\" i.e., they cannot stand to agree on one letter given their different dialects. So, uniting them into one dialect is hard for them and challenging for their tongues. Then, Gabriel (peace be upon him) came to him for the second time and informed him that Allah Almighty commands him to make his Ummah recite the Qur\u2019an in two letters. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said the same thing he said the first time. Then, Gabriel came to him for the third time and informed him that Allah commands him to make his Ummah recite in three letters. And the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said what he had said in the two previous times. Then for the fourth time, Gabriel (peace be upon him) came to him and said: \"Allah commands you to make your Ummah recite the Qur\u2019an in seven letters,\" thus, each one could recite in the manner that suits him, and that is easy for him, \"and in whichever letter they recite, they will be right\" and correct and their recitation will be sufficient and valid. His saying: \"seven letters\", means It was revealed in seven manners or seven dialects, which refers to facilitation and ease. It is said that the Qur'an was first revealed in the language of Quraysh and those who lived next to them from among the eloquent Arabs. Then, the Arabs were allowed to recite it in their usual languages despite the difference between them in words and grammatical rules. None of them was asked to leave his language for another one, given the difficulty involved and the pride they had and to make it easy for them to understand the intended meaning. This mentioned permissibility was not granted based on personal inclinations in such a way that everyone would change any word to its equivalent in his language; instead, the criterion here was to hear it from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\nThe Had\u012bth reflects the Prophet's keenness in facilitating and making things easy for his Ummah.\nIt also sheds light on the mercy of Allah Almighty towards His slaves by lightening their burden and revealing the Qur\u2019an in seven letters.."}, {"number": 267, "hadith": "Abu W\u0101\u2019il reported:  A man called Nah\u012bk ibn Sin\u0101n came to \u2018Abdullah and said: \"O Abu \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n, how do you recite this letter?

As if he was shocked and rebuking him. Nah\u012bk ibn Sin\u0101n gave him an answer denoting how he believed that he had perfected the recitation of the whole Qur\u2019an, as he informed him that he used to recite the Mufassal (short Surahs) in one single Rak\u2018ah, which indicates the great extent of his memorization and perfection. It is said: The Mufassal starts from Surat Muhammad, and it is said: Surat Q\u0101f, until the end of the Noble Qur\u2019an. It was called so because of the frequent separation between its Surahs with the line \"Bismill\u0101h ar-Rahm\u0101n ar-Rah\u012bm\" (In the Name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful). \u2018Abdullah ibn Mas\u2018\u016bd (may Allah be pleased with him) did not answer his question because he got the impression that he was not seeking guidance; rather, he said to him: \"Like the hasty recitation of poetry?!\" \"Hadhdh\" (hasty recitation) means excessive hastiness and extreme speed, i.e., do you recite the Qur\u2019an hastily without reflecting upon it as if you are reciting poetry?! As if Ibn Mas\u2018\u016bd was criticizing him for reciting the Mufassal in one single Rak\u2018ah without reflecting upon and contemplating the verses.\nThen, Ibn Mas\u2018\u016bd (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"Verily, there are people who recite the Qur'an, but it does not go beyond their collarbones,\" which is an indirect reference to incomprehension, i.e., there are people who recite the Qur'an without reflecting upon its verses or contemplating its meanings. Hence, it does not reach their hearts through contemplation and humility, and it does not ascend to heaven, and they do not, thus, receive a reward for it. \"Turquwah\" (collarbone): It is the protruding upper chest bone from the beginning of the shoulder to the bottom of the neck.\nThen, \u2018Abdullah ibn Mas\u2018\u016bd (may Allah be pleased with him) informed him that when the Qur\u2019an is recited in a reflective and contemplative manner, and the heart consequently grasps its meanings and understands its lessons, it becomes of benefit to its reciter, and this is what is required of a Muslim and is the objective of reciting the Qur\u2019an. Then, he clarified to him that the acts of prayer that have a better and bigger reward are more Ruk\u016b\u2018 and Suj\u016bd, not the lengthy recitation in which the reciter does not reflect upon the meanings of the verses.\nThen, he taught him, saying: I am well-acquainted with the Surahs, which are called \"Nazh\u0101\u2019ir\" and which are the Surahs that have similar meanings or have a similar length, that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to combine in his Rak'ahs during prayer reciting two of them in every Rak'ah.\nIbn Mas\u2018\u016bd then stood up and entered his house, followed by the T\u0101bi'i' Alqamah ibn Qays, who wanted to ask him about these Surahs which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to combine. Then, \u2018Alqamah came out and said to the people: Ibn Mas\u2018\u016bd (may Allah be pleased with him) informed me about them.\nAnother version reads: 'Alqamah informed them that the Nazh\u0101\u2019ir are \"twenty Surahs from the Mufassal,\" i.e., twenty of the small Surahs according to the order of the Mus-haf that was arranged by 'Abdullah ibn Mas\u2018\u016bd whose order varied from that of Zayd ibn Th\u0101bit. These Surahs were mentioned by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd on the authority of Ibn Mas\u2018\u016bd (may Allah be pleased with him) and they are: Ar-Rahm\u0101n and An-Najm in a Rak\u2018ah, Al-Qamar and Al-H\u0101qqah in a Rak\u2018ah, At-T\u016br and Adh-Dh\u0101riy\u0101t in a Rak\u2018ah, Al-W\u0101qi\u2018ah and Al-Qalam in a Rak\u2018ah, Al-Ma\u2018\u0101rij and An-N\u0101zi\u2018\u0101t in a Rak\u2018ah, Al-Mutaffif\u012bn and \u2018Abasa in a Rak\u2018ah, Al-Muddaththir and Al-Muzzammil in a Rak\u2018ah, Al-Ins\u0101n and Al-Qiy\u0101mah in a Rak\u2018ah, An-Naba\u2019 and Al-Mursal\u0101t in a Rak\u2018ah, and Ad-Dhukh\u0101n and At-Takw\u012br in a Rak\u2018ah. If it is said Ad-Dukh\u0101n is not from the Mufassal, how did he count it from the Mufassal? The answer: It is a metaphor, as it was mentioned in a version in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections: Eighteen Surahs from the Mufassal and two Surahs from the {H\u0101 M\u012bm} family.\nThe Had\u012bth encourages reflection upon the Qur\u2019an and abstention from reciting it hastily.\nIt also emphasizes the status and knowledge of Ibn Mas\u2018\u016bd (may Allah be pleased with him).."}, {"number": 268, "hadith": "Abu Basrah al-Ghif\u0101ri reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) led us in the \u2018Asr (afternoon) prayer at Al-Mukhammas and said: \"This prayer was presented to those before you, but they wasted it. So, whoever observes it will have his reward doubled, and there is no prayer after it until the Sh\u0101hid appears.\" Sh\u0101hid: the star..", "commentary": "Prayer is the second pillar of Islam. The 'Asr prayer has a great merit. Hence, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) urges Muslims to observe it.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Abu Basrah al-Ghif\u0101ri (may Allah be pleased with him) reports that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) led some of his Companions in the \u2018Asr prayer at Al-Mukhammas, which is the name of a path in Mount \u2018Ayr on the way to Makkah. Then, he informed them that the 'Asr prayer was enjoined upon the preceding nations, but they did not observe it properly, not performing it in its due time, taking it lightly, and abandoning it. Then, Allah gave it to the Ummah of Islam, \"so, whoever observes it will have his reward doubled\"; the first reward is for observing it, unlike those who neglected it, and the second is a recompense for his deed like the rest of prayers. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) then forbade them from offering any supererogatory prayer until the sun sets and the \"Sh\u0101hid\", which is the star, appears. It was called \"Sh\u0101hid\" (witness) because it appears and is present at night and because a star does not appear and is not seen except after sunset. This does not contradict the confirmed texts that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) prayed Maghrib by sunset, as mentioned in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections and others.\nThis is a prohibition of prayer at sunset because it was when those who worshipped the sun used to pray. The word \"after\" here is not meant in a general sense; rather, it is meant to refer to the time of sunset and what is close to it. It is said that the prohibition of prayer during this time is only meant to prohibit delaying the obligatory prayer without a valid excuse until it is performed close to sunset. This prohibition does not include performing obligatory prayers or making up for missed prayers; it is exclusive to the supererogatory prayer.\nThe Had\u012bth encourages the observance of prayer.\nIt also encourages the observance of prayers in their due time.\nIt clarifies the merit of this Ummah as it carefully maintains a prayer that was not maintained by the preceding nations.\nIt also points out that the reward of whoever observes the \u2018Asr prayer is doubled.."}, {"number": 269, "hadith": "\u2018Uqbah ibn \u2018\u0100mir al-Juhani reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to forbid us from praying or burying our deceased ones at three times: when the sun begins to rise until it is fully risen; when the sun is at its highest point in the sky at noon until it passes its zenith; and when the sun starts setting until it fully sets..", "commentary": "Allah Almighty sent His Prophet Muhammad (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to all humankind as a guide, bringer of good news, and a warner. There is no goodness for them concerning their life or death except that he guided them to it and urged them to do it. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was keen to preserve for the Muslims their creed. For example, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade them from praying or burying their dead at three times, which are: \"When the sun begins to rise;\" this is at the beginning of its rise and appearance. In modern estimation, this is nearly 15 minutes after sunrise. He forbade this because it is a time in which the sun-worshipers used to pray and prostrate to it, as it is a time in which the the sun rises between the two horns the devil. The second time: \"When the sun is at its highest point in the sky at noon;\" this is at midday, when the sun is in the middle of the sky. This is a time when any standing object at noon no longer has a shadow towards the east or the west, and it is the time of extreme heat. He forbade this timing because Hellfire is flared up during it. The forbidden time continues until the sun passes its zenith for a little towards the west, and there comes the noon at which the time of the Zhuhr prayer comes. The third timing: \"and when the sun starts setting,\" i.e., it moves towards setting until it completely sets, and the disc of the sun disappears. This is a time in which the sun sets between the two horns of the devil. This prohibition does not apply to the obligatory prayers that are performed within their appointed times or as missed prayers; rather,, it applies to supererogatory prayers.\nIn the Had\u012bth: The prohibition of praying at these times\nAnd in it: The prohibition of burying the dead at these times."}, {"number": 270, "hadith": "\u2018Amr ibn \u2018Abasah as-Sulami (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: In J\u0101hiliyyah (the pre-Islamic period of ignorance), I used to think that people were misguided and that they were not on the right path, as they worshipped idols. Then, I heard of a man in Makkah who was telling new things. So, I mounted my camel and went to him. I found that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was hiding, for his people were aggressive toward him. So, I acted gently until I entered his place. I said to him: \"Who are you?\" He said: \"I am a Prophet.\" I said: \"What is a Prophet?\" He said: \"Allah sent me.'' I said: \"What did He send you with?\" He said: \"He sent me with [a message] of maintaining kinship ties, breaking the idols, and upholding the oneness of Allah without associating anything with him.\" I said: \"Who is with you on that?\" He said: \"A free man and a slave man.'' He said: At that time only Abu Bakr and Bil\u0101l were with him. I said: \"I shall follow you.'' He said: \"You cannot do that today. Do you not see my situation and that of the people? However, return to your people, and when you hear that I have succeeded in my mission, come to me.'' So, I went to my people. Later, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went to Mad\u012bnah. It was until some of my people went to Mad\u012bnah that I said: \"What happened to this man who came to Mad\u012bnah?\" They said: \"People are hastening to him. His own people wanted to kill him, but they could not.\" So, I went to Mad\u012bnah and entered his place and said: \"O Messenger of Allah, do you recognize me?\" He said: \"Yes, you are the one who met me in Makkah.\" I said: \"O Messenger of Allah, tell me of what Allah has taught you, which I am ignorant of. Tell me about prayer.\" He said: \"Perform the morning prayer. Then, do not pray until the sun has risen up to the height of a lance, for when it rises, it rises between two horns of a devil. It is when the disbelievers prostrate themselves to it. Then, pray, for the prayer is witnessed and attended, until the shadow of the lance shrinks. Then, do not pray, for at that time Hell is fired up. Then, pray when the shadow becomes longer, for the prayer is witnessed and attended, until you perform \u2018Asr. Then, do not pray until the sun sets, for it sets between two horns of a devil. It is when the disbelievers prostrate themselves to it.\" I further said: \"O Prophet, tell me about ablution.'' He said: \"When any of you approaches his ablution water and rinses his mouth and nose, the sins of his face, his mouth, and nose will \u2018fall\u2019. Then, when he washes his face as Allah commanded him, the sins of his face fall with water from the edges of his beard. Then, when he washes his hands up to the elbows, the sins of his hands fall with water from his fingertips. Then, when he wipes over his head, the sins of his head fall with water from the ends of his hair. Then, when he washes his feet up to the ankles, the sins of his feet fall with water from his toes. Then, when he stands up for prayer, praises Allah Almighty, extols Him, glorifies Him as He deserves, and empties his heart for Allah, he becomes free from his sins as he was on the day his mother gave birth to him.'' \u2018Amr ibn \u2018Abasah narrated this Had\u012bth to Abu \u2019Um\u0101mah, a Companion of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Thereupon, Abu Um\u0101mah said to him: \"O \u2018Amr ibn \u2018Abasah, think about what you are saying. Will a man be getting all of this on one occasion?\" \u2018Amr said: \"O Abu \u2019Um\u0101mah, I am old in age, weak in bones, and close to death. I do not need to tell lies about Allah or the Messenger of Allah. Had I not heard this from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) only once, twice, thrice - and he counted up to seven times - I would not have narrated it. However, I heard it more than that.\".", "commentary": "Islam emerged in a world filled with oppression, Shirk (polytheism), and ignorance. The brightness of its teachings was strange to those who lived in complete darkness. Its earlier followers suffered severe tribulations, as they were very few and their enemies regarded them as weak and humiliated, and they would subject them to subjugation and harm, for they did not possess the means of protection either by being large in number or by strength. This was before Allah Almighty endowed them with Hijrah (emigration) to Mad\u012bnah, where He provided them with refuge, empowered them, helped them, and made them victorious over their enemies. In this Had\u012bth, the Companion \u2018Amr ibn \u2018Abasah as-Sulami (may Allah be pleased with him)\u2014who was the half-brother of Abu Dharr from the mother's side; their mother was Ramlah, from Banu al-Waq\u012b\u2018ah ibn Har\u0101m ibn Ghif\u0101r, and he was from Banu Sulaym\u2014says that in J\u0101hiliyyah,  people were polytheists. It was called as such due to the prevalence of their ignorance. He used to think that people were misguided and did not follow anything of the truth or the religion that would benefit them with Allah Almighty. \"as they worshipped idols.\" An idol is anything worshiped apart from Allah, be it made of stone, wood, or trees, and whether it takes the form of a human being or not. Later, he heard about the emergence of a man - meaning the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) - in Makkah who was telling new things concerning Allah Almighty, i.e., the new things related to the prophethood, the message, and the revelation of Allah to him, and the command He sent to him about Tawh\u012bd (monotheism) and the falsity of associating partners with Allah Almighty. So, he mounted his riding animal and traveled to Makkah to learn about the affair of this Prophet. He found the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) hiding from the disbelievers because they were aggressive to him. So, he searched for him in Makkah in a gentle and kind manner so that the Quraysh disbelievers would not repel him, until he found the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). \u2018Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) asked the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): \"What are you?\" i.e., what about your condition and your affair? He did not say, \"Who are you?\" because he did not want to ask about himself but about his traits. In response, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: \"I am a Prophet,\" one of the prophets of Allah, as Allah sent revelation to me. He asked him about the reality that distinguishes a prophet from others, and the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) replied to him that Allah sent him to all humankind. He further asked him: \"What did He send you with?\" In reply, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) told him that He sent him with a message of upholding the ties of kinship, who are a person's relatives and all those who are related to him by blood, whether he is an inheritor of them or not. The tie becomes more affirmed if they have a closer blood relationship. The Prophet's response here was appropriate for the questioner or considering the time and condition. The upholding of kinship ties is probably singled out in consideration of the condition of the Arabs, or because other obligations had not yet been prescribed. And he informed him that Allah Almighty sent him with a message of breaking and destroying the idols, prohibiting the devotion of worship to them, and that oneness must be attributed to Allah alone and worship be devoted to Him alone, not associating any of the creation as partners with Him. \u2018Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) asked the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): \"Who is with you on that\" Tawh\u012bd and religion? The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"A free man and a slave man.\" \u2018Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) at the time had with him Abu Bakr as-Sidd\u012bq (may Allah be pleased with him), by whom he meant the free man, and Bil\u0101l ibn Rab\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him), by whom he meant the slave man, among those who believed in him (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), believed his message, and followed his religion. \u2018Amr ibn \u2018Abasah as-Sulami (may Allah be pleased with him) said to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): \"I shall follow you\" and this religion, referring to his conversion to Islam. Hence, I shall accompany you and be with you in this position you are in. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: \"You cannot do that on this day of yours,\" i.e., at the present time. This is due to the weakness of the Muslims. It is feared that you will be harmed by the Qurayshi disbelievers. He did not reject his conversion to Islam, but rejected the idea that he would remain with him, citing as the reason for that the few supporters of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and the strength of the disbelievers and the severe animosity they displayed. So, he ordered him to go back to his people, remain among them, and continue to be Muslim, and when he hears about the dominance of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his victory over the polytheists and the spread of his call across the land, he should come to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). This is an example of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) talking about future and unseen things, and it falls under the signs of his prophethood (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). \u2018Amr ibn \u2018Abasah (may Allah be pleased with him) returned to his people Banu Sulaym. Then, after a while, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) emigrated to Mad\u012bnah after staying in Makkah as a prophet for thirteen years, calling people to Tawh\u012bd and the abandonment of Shirk. Meanwhile, \u2018Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) was living among his people. So, he began to look out for news about the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) while he was in Mad\u012bnah, asking travelers who would pass him by. This continued until there came a group, between three and nine persons, from the people of Yathrib, which was the old name for Mad\u012bnah, before the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) changed it to Taybah and T\u0101bah. He asked them: \"What happened to this man who came to Mad\u012bnah?\" He posed the question in this way so as to conceal his condition from whom he asked, lest they might be enemies of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and so they would not tell him the truth, if they knew he was following his religion. This reflects the good understanding, wisdom, and intelligence of \u2018Amr ibn \u2018Abasah (may Allah be pleased with him). They answered him: People are hastening to him to follow his religion and enter Islam. \"His people wanted to,\" i.e., the Quraysh disbelievers wanted to \"kill him\" by various methods of cunning and deception, \"but they could not.\" Rather, Allah turned their plots back on their necks and protected His Prophet from that. It was said: This is intended to refer to what the Quraysh tribe plotted against the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) after his Hijrah, including the battles of Badr, \u2019Uhud, and Al-Ahz\u0101b, and others. But they could not eliminate him, as Allah Almighty granted him victory over them. Also, the intended meaning is probably what Allah Almighty mentions in the verse that reads: {And [remember] when the disbelievers plotted against you to take you as captive, kill you, or expel you. They plan, and Allah also plans, but Allah is the Best of those who plan.} [Surat al-Anf\u0101l: 30] This is when they plotted against him in these ways. So, Allah permitted him to immigrate, and after he went to Mad\u012bnah, Allah Almighty revealed to him \"Surat al-Anf\u0101l\" wherein He mentions His favors upon him and the affliction he had suffered.\nThen, \u2018Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said that he came to Mad\u012bnah - after the battles of Badr, \u2019Uhud, the Trench, and Khaybar - and entered the Prophet's place and said: \"O Messenger of Allah, do you recognize me?\" He replied: Yes, you are the one who met me in Makkah. So, \u2018Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) asked to tell him about what Allah taught the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) of which \u2018Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) was ignorant. He also asked the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to tell him about the prayer and its time. In response, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) instructed him to offer the morning prayer - and its time begins with the appearance of the true dawn - and then desist from prayer until the sun appears and rises to the height with which prayer is no longer disliked; that's 15 minutes after sunrise, according to modern estimation. This demonstrates the times in which prayer was prohibited, and he explained to him the reason behind this prohibition, saying that the sun rises between two horns of a devil, and at that time the disbelievers who worship the sun prostrate themselves to it. The meaning: The devil adorned to some people the worship of the sun at this time, and he used to take sunrise between the two horns in his head and approach it, and so it would rise between his two horns. And the same happens at the time of sunset. It is as if those who prostrate to the sun do prostrate to him. So, this is meant to keep away from imitation of the disbelievers at their time of prayer. This prohibition pertains to supererogatory prayers whose performance is not associated with a specific reason. A Muslim should not offer them at these two times. As for the missed obligatory prayers, they may be performed at all times of prohibition.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informed him that after that time he could offer as many supererogatory prayers as he wished, as related in the version by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd, \"for the prayer is witnessed and attended,\" i.e., the angels attend it to write down its reward and bear witness for those who perform it. So, it is closer to acceptance and the attainment of mercy. So, he prays \"until the shadow of the lance shrinks,\" i.e., the shadow rises with the lance or in the lance, and nothing of it remains on the ground. This refers to the Arab martial lance, which is nine mediocre spans long. The lance was particularly mentioned because when the Arabs wanted to know the time, they would erect their lances on the ground and then look at their shadows.\nWhen things no longer have a shadow, one should refrain from offering supererogatory prayers that are not associated with a specific reason, for this time is one in which \"Hell is fired up,\" i.e., it is intensely kindled. \"when the shadow becomes longer\" towards the east, \"then pray\" any prayer you want to offer. \"for the prayer is witnessed and attended.\" Continue to pray as much as you wish \"until you perform \u2018Asr.\" Then, stop offering supererogatory prayers after \u2018Asr, until the sun sets, for it sets between two horns of a devil, and this is a time at which the disbelievers prostrate themselves to it, as previously mentioned.\nThen, \u2018Amr ibn \u2018Abasah (may Allah be pleased with him) asked the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) about ablution and how to perform it. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"When any of you approaches his ablution water,\" i.e., brings water to perform ablution therewith. \"and rinses his mouth\" by moving water inside the mouth and then discharging it out. \"and nose\" by inserting water into the nose and then blowing it out to remove any filth inside. the sins of his face, his mouth, and nose \"fall.\" \"Then, when he washes his face as Allah commanded him,\" i.e., in the verse that reads: {when you rise up for prayer, wash your faces.} [Surat al-M\u0101\u2019idah: 6] \"the sins of his face will fall with water from the edges of his beard.\" He mentioned the beard in light of what is more common; yet, it also applies to those who have no beard, such as the beardless men or women. \"Then, when he washes his hands up to the elbows,\" which are the joints in the middle of the arm, \"the sins of his hands fall with water from his fingertips. Then, when he wipes over his head, the sins of his head fall with water from the ends of his hair.\" He mentioned hair in light of what is more common, yet it also applies to those who have no hair. \"Then, when he washes his feet up to the ankles\" - the two protruding bones at the joint connecting the foot and leg - \"the sins of his feet fall with water from his toes.\" If a person performs ablution in this way and enters the prayer, praises Allah, lauds Him by the well-established attributes, lauds Him by exalting Him above what does not befit Him, and extols Him by ascribing to Him the attributes of glory, might, and honor of which He is worthy; \"and empties his heart for Allah,\" Almighty, i.e., he empties his heart from the impurity of attachment to and reliance upon other than Allah, \"he becomes free from his sins\" and misdeeds and gets purified from them as he was pure from all sins \"on the day his mother gave birth to him.\"\n\u2018Amr ibn \u2018Abasah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated this Had\u012bth before Abu \u2019Um\u0101mah, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). So, Abu \u2019Um\u0101mah said to him: \"O \u2018Amr ibn \u2018Abasah, think about,\" i.e., consider, ponder, \"what you are saying\" about this abundant reward in return for this little act in one situation and one place; a man is given this great reward! The wording by An-Nas\u0101\u2019i: \"Is all of this given in one situation?!\" This does not denote suspicion by Abu \u2019Um\u0101mah of \u2018Amr (may Allah be pleased with both of them). It is only wonder at the immensity of Allah's bounty. \u2018Amr replied: \"O Abu Um\u0101mah, I am old in age,\" \"weak in bones,\" i.e., my bones have become thin and lean - a reference to his weakness. \"and close to death.\" \"I do not need\" or am prompted \"to tell lies about Allah\" Almighty\" or the Messenger of Allah\" (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). The meaning: The usual causes of lying are non-existent in me. I am not a liar. So, \"Had I not heard this from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) only once, twice, thrice - and he counted up to seven times,\" i.e., he said: four times, until he said: seven times. \"I would not have narrated it.

As for the one who could not catch up with the prayer at the beginning of its time for a valid excuse, he is permitted to pray at the end of its time and to catch up with the prayer before sunrise and before sunset. Or perhaps the prohibition refers to the act of seeking the rising and setting of the sun on purpose, as for the one who does not do this on purpose - like the one who wakes up from his sleep or the one who remembers after being forgetful - it is permissible for him to pray and there is no blame on him.\nThe Had\u012bth warns against keenness on praying at the time when the sun rises and sets.."}, {"number": 272, "hadith": "Abu Salamah reported  that he asked '\u0100\u2019ishah about the two prostrations that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to pray after 'Asr, she said: \"He used to pray them before 'Asr, but then he got distracted or forgot them, so he prayed them after 'Asr; then, he continued observing them, for whenever he offered a prayer, he would stick to observing it.\".", "commentary": "Prayer is the best matter, and a Muslim is allowed to offer voluntary prayer at any time of night or day except for the times in which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) prohibited voluntary prayer, namely after dawn until sunrise and after 'Asr until sunset.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi'i Abu Salamah ibn' Abdur-Rahm\u0101n ibn' Awf reports that he asked the Mother of the Believers, '\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), about the two Rak'ahs (unit of prayer) that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to pray after 'Asr, and why he prayed them, or whether the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) performed them regularly or not.

The most entitled among people to this, and the first ones addressed with this in the Qur\u2019an and the Sunnah, are the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them).\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Abu \u2018Ubaydah \u2018\u0100mir ibn \u2018Abdullah ibn Mas\u2018\u016bd narrates that Ka\u2018b ibn \u2018Ujrah (may Allah be pleased with him) entered the mosque, referring to the mosque of K\u016bfah, a city in Iraq, to offer the Friday prayer. He found \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n ibn \u2019Umm al-Hakam - nephew of Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah ibn Abi Sufy\u0101n ibn Harb whom Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) assigned as the ruler of K\u016bfah in 58 AH, then after a year or more, he was dismissed - preaching to people while sitting on the pulpit, not standing as known in the Friday sermon. Ka\u2018b (may Allah be pleased with him) condemned this saying: \"Look at this deceitful person,\" because he was angry at the one who had violated the Prophet's Sunnah, \"he is preaching while sitting,\" not doing what the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did and not following his example, although the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) adopted this practice persistently. Allah Almighty says: {Indeed, you have an excellent example in the Messenger of Allah.} [Surat al-Ahz\u0101b: 21] Allah Almighty also says: {Whatever the Messenger gives you, accept it.} [Surat al-Hashr: 7] Moreover, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Pray as you saw me pray.\" [Narrated by Al-Bukh\u0101ri] Hence, his example should be followed when it comes to prayer and the delivery of the Friday sermon.\nThen, he supported his words with a verse from Allah's Book, in which Allah Almighty says: {When they see some merchandise or amusement, they rush towards it and leave you standing.} [Surat al-Jumu\u2018ah: 11] Here, Allah mentioned that His Prophet was standing while delivering the Friday sermon.\nThe Had\u012bth draws the preacher's attention to standing while delivering the Khutbah.\nIt also calls the scholars' attention to enjoining good and forbidding evil.\nThe Had\u012bth sheds light on how the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used to intensely get angry with whoever violated the Sunnah, even if it was someone who must be obeyed and respected from among the rulers, for no obedience is due to a creature when it comes to disobeying the Creator.."}, {"number": 283, "hadith": "\u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Umar and Abu Hurayrah reported that they heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say: \"Either some people stop abandoning the Friday prayers, or Allah will seal their hearts and then they will be among the heedless.\".", "commentary": "The Friday prayer is of great significance in Islam. Allah Almighty made it obligatory for non-traveling men to go out for it when the Muezzin makes the Adh\u0101n, calling for it, and He urged them to attend this prayer and warned against neglecting it. An example is this Had\u012bth in which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Either some people stop abandoning the Friday prayers,\" i.e., they abandon and fail to perform it out of negligence and laziness, without an excuse. If they do not comply and attend the Friday prayer, Allah will seal their hearts, by putting a seal and cover over them, and deny them His grace and bounty and place in them ignorance, roughness, and hardness. \"and then they will be among the heedless\" away from doing the deeds that benefit them and leaving what harms them. Thus, they will be among those overtaken by heedlessness, as they forgot Allah, and so He forgot them. This serves as a strong deterrent against the abandonment and neglect of the Friday prayer.."}, {"number": 284, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn Samurah reported: I used to perform the prayers with the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and his prayer was moderate in length and his sermon was moderate in length..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to enjoin the facilitation of worship and not going into hardship in performing it, and he would set an example of this through his own practice, so that every Muslim would imitate him.\nIn this Had\u012bth, J\u0101bir ibn Samurah (may Allah be pleased with him) says that he would persistently perform the obligatory prayers - the five prayers and the Friday prayer - with the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and his prayer was moderate in length, suitable for the young and old and not hard for anyone. He would do that to avoid making the prayer too long for people.\nAs for the Muslim-narrated Had\u012bth in which \u2018Amm\u0101r ibn Y\u0101sir (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"The lengthiness of a man\u2019s prayer and the shortness of his sermon are a sign of his proper understanding; so, make the prayer long and the sermon short.\" The intended meaning here is that prayer should be long compared to the sermon, not so long in a way that proves hard for the worshipers.\nIn the Had\u012bth: We are urged not to prolong the sermon and the five prayers.."}, {"number": 285, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h reported: When the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) delivered a sermon, his eyes would turn red, his voice would become louder, and his anger would become more intense, as if he were warning of an army, saying: \"They will attack you in the morning, or they will attack you in the evening.\" And he would say: \"I and the Hour have been sent like these two,\" holding his index and middle fingers. Then, he would say: \"To proceed: Indeed, the best speech is the Book of Allah; the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad; the evilest matters are those that are newly invented; and every innovation is misguidance.\" He would then say: \"I am nearer to every believer than himself. So, whoever leaves behind some wealth, it is for his family, and whoever leaves behind a debt or dependent children, then they are both my responsibility.\" [In a version]: In the Prophet's sermon on Friday, he would praise Allah, laud Him, and then he would subsequently speak, as his voice went loud; then, he narrated the same Had\u012bth..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was an eloquent preacher, and he would say what moves people, admonishes them, gives them glad tidings, and warns them. He would also use the tools of rhetorical effects, such as raising and lowering the voice and using the movement of the hand and the body, as well as other things in which preachers should follow his example.\nIn this Had\u012bth, J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) informs about what the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to do in the Friday sermon. He says that when he delivered a sermon to the people and reminded them of the promise and warning, and the commands and prohibitions, \"his eyes would turn red,\" i.e., their redness would become greater than usual. \"his voice would become louder, and his anger would become more intense,\" which means that he would interact with the topic of the sermon; hence, this would happen to him. By intense anger, he meant to describe his condition as a person in anger, and this was probably because some of them were found to disobey his commands and prohibitions, and some were neglectful of their duties. This is how a preacher's condition should be - consistent with the topic he speaks about. He should not enjoin something while his outward appearance denotes the opposite. \"as if he were warning of an army,\" alluding to the loudness of his voice (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) among them. The warner of an army is a person who watches the enemy and informs the people about their condition so that they can get prepared. So, the Prophet's admonition was given in this manner, due to his care about the people and his desire to warn them of the Hereafter and their lack of preparedness for it. Thus, it was as if he was warning them of the emergence of an attacking army that would come to them in the morning or in the evening.\nOne of the statements the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to make in his sermons: \"I have been sent and the Hour is like these two,\" joining his two fingers: the forefinger and the middle finger, i.e., the period between the Prophet's time and the coming of the Day of Judgment is short like the distance between the forefinger and the middle finger. He is the last Prophet before the Hour. So, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) is one of the signs of the imminence of the Hour. After his mission, the time remaining for the coming of the Hour is less than the time that passed.\nAt the start of the sermon, he used to say: \"To proceed;\" is a phrase to separate between parts of speech when the speaker wants to shift from one topic to another. The meaning: I say after the previous testimony of faith and praise of Allah Almighty. \"Indeed, the best speech is the Book of Allah;\" there is no speech except that the speech of Allah is better than that. The speech of Allah means the noble Qur'an. \"the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad;\" guidance is the way of life and manner. There is no way and path except that the path of the Prophet is better than that. So, his path, way of life, and manner - including Tawh\u012bd, rulings, and acts of worship - should be followed. \"the most evil matters,\" i.e., the ugliest religious matters, not the worldly ones. \"are those that are newly invented,\" i.e., inventions and innovations that have no basis in the Shariah that attests to their validity and permissibility. These are called Bida\u2018 (innovations). \"and every innovation is misguidance,\" i.e., and every invention in the religion in a way not done by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his Companions is misguidance and deviation and departure from the Prophet's path; it is not part of the guidance and the right course he came with.\nIn one of the Prophet's statements in his sermons, he said: \"I am nearer to every believer than himself,\" i.e., I am the most entitled among people to him regarding all matters of worldly life and the Hereafter. As Allah Almighty says: {The Prophet has a greater claim over the believers than their own selves.} [Surat al-Ahz\u0101b: 6] He is the most compassionate of all people towards them. Their souls call them to ruin, while he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) calls them to salvation.\nHe (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informed that if any Muslim dies and leaves behind some wealth, his inheritors and relatives - i.e., his inheriting relatives - are more entitled to this wealth, which they take as an inheritance; and if anyone leaves behind a debt or dependents - children, wife, and those who cannot provide for themselves - the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) has a greater claim to him, repaying his debt and supporting those children and women he left behind. This stems from the Prophet's good character, his support of the Muslims, and his keenness that they should not be neglected.\nAnd in a version: \"In the Prophet's sermon on Friday, he would praise Allah and laud Him,\" i.e., he would begin it with praise and laudation. Part of what was reported from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in Khutbat al-H\u0101jah (the sermon of need) which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) taught his Companions is to say: \"Praise be to Allah. We praise Him and seek His help. Whoever Allah guides, none can lead astray, and whoever Allah leads astray, none can guide. I testify that there is no god but Allah, alone, with no partner, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.\" This praise and laudation is valid to say at the start of every sermon.\nIn the Had\u012bth: We are urged to follow the Prophet's guidance in the sermon.\nAnd in it: A preacher should interact with the topic while addressing the sermon to influence the people.\nAnd in it: Beginning the sermon with praise and lauding Allah."}, {"number": 286, "hadith": "Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s reported:  Dim\u0101d came to Makkah, and he was from Azd Shan\u016b\u2019ah. He used to provide Ruqyah against this wind (demonic possession). He heard some foolish people from the people of Makkah saying: Indeed, Muhammad is mad. So, he said: If I see that man, Allah might heal him through me. He said: He met him and said: O Muhammad, I provide Ruqyah against this wind and Allah heals whoever He wills through me. Do you desire (this)? Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: Praise be to Allah. We praise Him and seek His help. Whoever Allah guides, none can lead astray, and whoever Allah leads astray, none can guide. I testify that there is no god but Allah alone with no partner and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. To proceed, he said: He said: Repeat to me these words of yours. So, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) repeated them three times. He said: So, he said: I have heard the words of soothsayers, the words of magicians, and the words of poets, but I have never heard such words as yours, and they have reached the N\u0101\u2018\u016bs (depth) of the sea. He said: So, he said: Give me your hand to pledge allegiance to you on Islam. He said: And he pledged allegiance to him. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: And on behalf of your people? He replied: And on behalf of my people. He said: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) then sent an expedition, and they passed by his people. The expedition leader asked the army: Did you take anything from those? A man said: I took a Mit-harah (water utensil used for purification) from them. So, he said: Return it, for they are the people of Dim\u0101d..", "commentary": "The Prophet's way of life and that of the early Muslims was full of difficulties and obstacles for the sake of spreading the word of Allah Almighty. The disbelievers of Makkah used to keep a close watch on the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and all those who believed along with him. However, Allah's victory was definite as He granted His slave victory, honored His soldiers, and defeated the Confederates alone.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) narrates that Dim\u0101d ibn Tha'labah - who was from Azd Shan\u016b\u2019ah, which is a prominent tribe in Yemen and Azd is one of its tribes - came to Makkah and alighted there from a journey and this was at the beginning of the Prophet's mission. Dim\u0101d used to make Ruqyah, which refers to the incantations used for someone suffering from illnesses like fever, epilepsy, and other diseases. \"He used to provide Ruqyah against this wind,\" and \"wind\" here refers to madness and demonic possession as if they considered the insanity that afflicted a person and the diseases resulting from such possession a breath from the Jinn. Thus, they called it \"wind\". Dim\u0101d heard the fools and the ignorant from among the disbelievers of Makkah saying: \"Indeed, Muhammad is mad. So, he said: If I see that man\" whom you call mad, Allah might heal him through me if I make Ruqyah for him. Ibn' Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) met Dim\u0101d. Dim\u0101d informed him that he provided Ruqyah against possession and madness and that Allah had made him a cause for curing some diseases, so would you like me to make Ruqyah for you and help you get rid of the madness that people say you are afflicted with? The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) replied saying: \"Praise be to Allah,\" i.e., it is established and exclusive for Him, whether He is praised or not. \"We praise Him\" because it is obligatory upon us as well as beneficial for us. \"And seek His help\" in all our affairs. \"Whoever Allah guides\" to the path of declaring His Oneness and witnessing His uniqueness by virtue of His favor, \"none can lead astray\" from the creatures, and whoever He leads astray from the right path by virtue of His justice, \"none can guide\". \"I testify that there is no god but Allah, alone,\" i.e., One \"with no partner,\" i.e., none is truly worthy of worship but Him. \"And I testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger; to proceed,\" On hearing these words from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), Dim\u0101d asked the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to repeat these words once again. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) repeated them thrice. Thereupon, Dim\u0101d said: \"I have heard the words of soothsayers\" plural of \"soothsayer\", one who foretells the unseen with rhyming sentences and creative signals. \"The words of magicians\" plural of \"magician\", one who alludes to the eye or mind by what he says or does. \"And the words of poets\" is the plural of a poet, one who beautifies everything with his tongue to the extent that he disgraces what is beautiful and beautifies what is disgraceful. I heard the words of those, \"but I have never heard such words as yours,\" i.e., if you were one of these three, your words would sound like their words. He mentioned those three because the fools of Makkah used to describe him once as a soothsayer, another time as a magician, and a third time as a poet. Hence, he denied the three things they used to say about him.\nThen, Dim\u0101d said: \"And they have reached,\" i.e., these comprehensive words that you uttered and their impact on the heart of every living being along with their belief in them have reached the \"N\u0101\u2018\u016bs\" (depth) of the sea, and it was narrated the \"Q\u0101m\u016bs\", which is the middle and depth of the sea. In other words, they have reached the top and the highest peak of eloquence.\nThen, Dim\u0101d said: \"Give me your hand\" and extend it \"to pledge allegiance to you on Islam. And he pledged allegiance to\" the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Then, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: And on behalf of your people, i.e., and you pledge allegiance to Islam on behalf of your people as well whom you left behind in your country? Thereupon, Dim\u0101d said: \"And on behalf of my people.\" So, he pledged allegiance to Islam for himself and on behalf of his people.\nIbn' Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that after the Hijrah (emigration) to Mad\u012bnah, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) sent an expedition - part of the army that does not exceed one hundred men -. They passed by the people of Dim\u0101d ibn Tha'labah (may Allah be pleased with him). The expedition leader - i.e., its head - said to the army: \"Did you take,\" i.e., seize \"anything from those? A man said: I took a Mit-harah from them,\" which is a water utensil used for making Tah\u0101rah (ritual purification). He said: \"Return it,\" i.e., give it back to its owners \", for those are the people of Dim\u0101d\" ibn Tha'labah al-Azdi who pledged allegiance to Islam through Dim\u0101d. Hence, it is not permissible to seize their properties because they are Muslims.\nThe Had\u012bth sheds light on the Prophet's good manners, eloquence, and command of language.\nIt also shows how Dim\u0101d ibn Tha\u2018labah (may Allah be pleased with him) embraced Islam and the favor he did to his people.."}, {"number": 287, "hadith": "Abu W\u0101\u2019il reported: 'Amm\u0101r gave us a Khutbah (sermon), and he spoke briefly and eloquently.

On descending the pulpit, people said to him: \"O Abu al-Yaqzh\u0101n,\" which is 'Amm\u0101r's nickname, and they praised his eloquence and brevity and said to him: \"Would that you spoke longer,\" i.e., made it a little longer. He informed them that he heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say: \"A man's lengthy prayer,\" referring to the Friday prayer, i.e., making the prayer longer than the Khutbah in a way that does not make it arduous for those praying behind him; to be moderate between prolonging and shortening, \"and short Khutbah,\" i.e., shortening it \"is a sign of his understanding,\" i.e., a sign indicating the preacher's understanding when his speech is eloquent, brief, and clear. The command of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) contains: \"So, lengthen the prayer and shorten the Khutbah\", denotes ultimate moderation by prolonging the prayer moderately so that those who are not present and those who are far away from the mosque can catch up with it without harming those behind him with such a prolongation, and by shortening the Khutbah without failing to meet its proper standards and in a way that would make it easier to memorize what is mentioned therein as the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to do this in both.\nHis statement: \"For there is a charm in the eloquent speech,\" \"Eloquent speech\" here means expressing the intended meaning using the most articulate wording, which indicates understanding and the heart's intelligence. \"Charm\" means changing the way one regards something and not changing the truth of something. This statement was said as a form of praise by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) with which he ended his speech to guide the preacher to be eloquent and clear in his speech, as Allah Almighty has bestowed upon His slaves the blessing of teaching them eloquence and clarity. Then, he compared it to magic because the hearts feel a tendency towards it as the eloquent speech attracts hearts and causes them to incline to what the speaker is saying.\nThe Had\u012bth points out that it is Sunnah for the preacher not to lengthen the Khutbah.."}, {"number": 288, "hadith": "\u2018Adiyy ibn H\u0101tim reported:  A man delivered a sermon before the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and said: Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger is guided aright, and whoever disobeys them is deluded.

Say: And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger\" not \"disobeys them\". Here, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) called his attention to be cautious about stating such things in sermons and attended occasions because the basic rule here is simplicity and clarification along with avoidance of symbols and signs, unlike education, as the lesser the words are, the better their memorization becomes.\nThe Had\u012bth denotes that forbidding evil is to be carried out by those qualified to do so.."}, {"number": 289, "hadith": "\u2019Umm Hish\u0101m bint H\u0101rithah ibn an-Nu\u2018m\u0101n reported:  Our oven and the oven of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was the same for two years, or for a year and part of a year.

She asked the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) about the reason for that. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informed her that this is because women often complain and are not content with what is little, \"and show ingratitude to your spouses,\" i.e., you are ungrateful for the kindness of your husbands, and you deny their rights upon you. He explained that in another version of the Two Sah\u012bh Collections by saying: \"If you have always been good to one of them and then she sees something from you (not of her liking), she will say: I have never seen any good from you.\" So, she meets this kindness with ingratitude and denial. Ingratitude dominates her attitude, as if she insists on it, and insistence turns a minor sin into a major one. This is because the rights of the husband are great, and she is required to show gratitude to him and acknowledge his favor, as he takes care of her affairs and protects and preserves her, and he exerts himself in doing so. Indeed, Allah enjoins anyone to whom a favor is done to show gratitude for it.

This includes his practice in the Istisq\u0101\u2019 prayer (rain-seeking prayer), his display of humbleness to his Lord at the time of afflictions, like famine, and during supplication for the removal of affliction.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Anas ibn M\u0101lik (may Allah be pleased with him) reports that \"the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) prayed for rain,\" i.e., supplicated and asked for water and rainfall from Allah Almighty at the time of famine and drought. \"pointing the back of his hands to the sky,\" i.e., the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) turned his hands and pointed their backs towards the sky, contrary to his usual practice in supplication, as he would point his palms. He (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did that with optimism that the situation may change to the opposite, likewise when he turned his apparel upside down for seeking rain, as authenticated in the Two Sahih Collections.\nIt is reported in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to raise his hands in supplication until the whiteness of his armpit would be visible due to his extreme earnestness in supplicating, imploring, and begging Allah Almighty, for earnestly imploring Allah Almighty and supplicating to Him is one of the greatest means for removing affliction and hardship.."}, {"number": 302, "hadith": "Anas reported:  It rained while we were with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).

They asked the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): \"Why did you do this?\" A question asked by the Companions to know and learn the rationale behind the Prophet's act, as it was a new act practised by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) during rainfall, and all his acts are a Sunnah to be followed. His answer to their question was by mentioning the reason, saying: \"Because it has recently been with its Almighty Lord,\" i.e., it has descended from between the sky and earth, as Allah Almighty says: {And clouds between the sky and earth.} [Surat al-Baqarah: 164] Its Lord has recently formed it, and it is sustenance and mercy. Allah Almighty has called it \"mercy\", \"blessed\", and \"pure\" and has made it a means of life and a means for avoiding punishment.\nThe Had\u012bth highlights the act of revealing the body - apart from the \u2018Awrah (must-cover body parts) - during the fall of rain to fall on the body directly.\nIt also indicates that the less qualified person should ask the more qualified one about what he sees him doing if he does not know it to learn it and, thus, apply it and teach it to others.."}, {"number": 303, "hadith": "J\u0101bir reported:  The sun eclipsed during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) on the very day Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, the Prophet's son, died. The people said that it eclipsed on account of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm's death. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) stood up and led the people in prayer, performing six bowings and four prostrations. He started by making Takb\u012br (saying: All\u0101hu Akbar). He then recited and lengthened the recitation, then bowed nearly as long as he stood, then raised his head from Ruk\u016b '(bowing) and recited, but it was a shorter recitation than the first one. He then bowed nearly as long as he stood, then raised his head from Ruk\u016b 'and recited, but it was a shorter recitation than the second one. Then, he bowed nearly as long as he stood, then raised his head from Ruk\u016b '. Then, he fell into prostration and made two prostrations. Then, he stood up and again made three bowings, each of which was shorter than the preceding one and longer than the following one. His Ruk\u016b 'was nearly the same length as his Suj\u016bd (prostration). Then, he stepped back, and the rows behind him stepped back as well until we reached the extreme - [another version reads]: until he reached the women. Then, he stepped forward, and the people stepped forward along with him until he stood in his place. When he finished, the sun was bright. He said: O people, the sun and the moon are but two of Allah's signs, and they are not eclipsed on account of anyone's death - [another version reads]: on account of a human's death. So, when you see anything of this, offer prayer until darkness disappears. There is nothing of what you have been promised except that I saw it in this prayer of mine. Hellfire was brought, and that was when you saw me stepping back for fear of being affected by its heat, and I saw therein the owner of the curved staff dragging his intestines in the Fire. He used to steal the pilgrim with his curved staff. If he became aware, he would say: It got (accidentally) entangled in my curved staff, but if he was unaware of that, he would take that away. I also saw the cat owner who tied it without feeding it or letting it eat from the vermin of the earth until it died out of hunger. Then, Paradise was brought, and that was when you saw me stepping forward until I stood in my place, and I stretched my hand wanting to catch some of its fruits so you may see it, but it seemed to me that I should not do so.

Their rotation and their succession denote the perfection of Allah's making. The occurrence of lunar and solar eclipses entails fear of their obliteration and the occurrence of the Day of Judgment, which necessitates returning to Allah and resorting to Him through prayer and supplication, and this was the usual practice and the habit of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\nIn this Had\u012bth, J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) narrates that the sun eclipsed during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) on the day his son Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, whose mother was M\u0101riyah al-Qibtiyyah, died. He was born in 8 AH and died in 10 AH when he was eighteen months old. A solar eclipse occurs when all the sunlight or part of it disappears. People started saying that it eclipsed on account of the death of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, the Prophet's son, which was a common belief among them during the pre-Islamic era of ignorance. On seeing the solar eclipse, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) stood up and led the people in a two-Rak'ah prayer with three bowings and two prostrations. His recitation in his first standing was longer than in the second one, and his recitation in the second standing was longer than in the third one, and his bowing was nearly as long as his standing.\nDuring the prayer, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) stepped back. The rows behind him stepped back as well, i.e., he was moving backwards, and the men's rows behind him were moving backwards like him while maintaining their status in prayer until reaching the women's rows behind them. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) moved forward, and the people moved forward along with him until he returned to his first place. Then, he finished the prayer and \"the sun was bright,\" i.e., it returned to its former state and became bright and luminous again. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), then, said: \"O people, the sun and the moon are but two of Allah's signs,\" i.e., two signs with which He frightens His slaves, \"and they are not eclipsed on account of anyone's death\". Another version reads: \"On account of a human's death\". They are two subservient creatures that have no control over anything and have no ability to ward anything off themselves. This includes a reply to what some people mistakenly thought about the solar eclipse taking place because of the death of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, the Prophet's son. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) clarified to them that the solar eclipse is not caused by the death of any of the people on earth. \"So, when you see anything of this,\" i.e., the eclipse, \"offer prayer until the darkness goes away,\" i.e., the sun, and reappears when the eclipse is being removed. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), then, said to them: \"There is nothing of what you have been promised,\" i.e., nothing of what you have been promised to witness of Paradise, Hellfire, and other situations of the Day of Judgment \"except that I saw it in this prayer of mine\". Then, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) clarified to them the reason why he stepped back while praying and said: \"Hellfire was brought,\" i.e. brought forward, \"and that was when you saw me stepping back, for fear of being affected by its heat,\" i.e., its flame and its heat, and I saw in the fire the owner of the Mihjan (curved staff). Mihjan: a staff with a crooked top, and it is said: a long wood with a jagged piece of iron on the top; and the owner of the curved staff was dragging his Qusb, i.e., dragging his intestines, which were extending out of his belly, in the Fire. He used to steal the pilgrims' belongings with his curved staff in worldly life. If his act were noticed and detected, he would say: This stolen thing got accidentally entangled in my curved staff, and if his act went unnoticed and unknown and nobody saw him, he would get away with what he stole with his curved staff.\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) also informed them that he saw in Hellfire, the owner of the cat, i.e., a woman from the children of Israel who locked up a cat and tied it without feeding it or letting it eat from the vermin of the earth, i.e., its pests and insects, until the cat died out of hunger.\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) then informed them that Paradise was brought to him, and that was when they saw him returning to the first position from which he stepped back, stretching his hand, wanting to take one of its fruits so that the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) would look at it. Then, it seemed to him that he should not do so. Once again, he confirmed and repeated what he had previously said that nothing of what they had been promised to witness of Paradise, Hellfire, and other situations of the Day of Judgment except that he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) saw in this prayer of his.\nIt is said: The famous opinion regarding the manner of the Eclipse prayer is that it is two Rak\u2018ahs, and in each Rak\u2018ah, there are two incidents of standing, two recitations, and two bowings, and as for Suj\u016bd, there are two prostrations like in other Rak\u2018ahs, whether the eclipse lasts for a long time or not.\nWhat causes the solar and lunar eclipse is the fact that the moon is a dark body that derives its light from the sunlight, like a mirror that reflects the light falling upon it, making the viewer imagine that it is luminous, and the same applies to the earth.

Then, the afflicted person should supplicate, saying: \"O Allah, reward me,\" i.e., grant me the reward and recompense \"for my affliction, and give me something better than that in exchange for it,\" i.e., give me a substitute for what I lost due to this affliction and make the substitute better than the lost thing.\nWhoever says that his reward is that Allah will give him something better in exchange for what he lost in this affliction of his. Another version by Muslim has this addition: \"except that Allah will give the reward for his affliction.\" Allah will record his reward for that.\nThen, Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) mentioned that when her husband Abu Salamah \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abd al-Asad al-Makhz\u016bmi (may Allah be pleased with him) died, she seemed to have remembered the Prophet's instruction, but she thought to herself or uttered it in wonder: \"Which of the Muslims is better than Abu Salamah?!\" She wondered at how to apply the Prophet's statement \"except that Allah will give him something better than that in exchange\" to her disaster, given her reverence for Abu Salamah (may Allah be pleased with him). At the root of her wonder lay her belief that none was better than Abu Salamah (may Allah be pleased with him), and she would not expect that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) might marry her, for he was outside this general categorization. Then, clarifying why Abu Salamah (may Allah be pleased with him) was meritorious, she said that \"his family was the first to immigrate to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\" So, he was the first to immigrate along with his family and dependents. After her wonder, she complied with the command of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him); \"I then said the words,\" i.e., the phrase \"we belong to Allah, and to Him we will return\" and the subsequent supplication. So, she said that Allah Almighty gave her the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in exchange, by making her his wife. Thus, he constituted better compensation for her than her husband Abu Salamah (may Allah be pleased with him).\nThen, Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with him) mentioned how she was engaged to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and what she asked for. She said that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) sent H\u0101tib ibn Abi Balta\u2018ah (may Allah be pleased with him) to propose marriage to her on his behalf. Apologizing to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) out of fear that she may not fulfill his rights, she said that she had a daughter, namely Zaynab bint Abi Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her), who was young at the time and still under her care. She also stated that she was very jealous. These two things have their effect on the discharge of marital duties, leading to non-fulfillment of them. Also, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had other wives before her, and her extreme jealousy would make her unable to get together with the other wives. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"As for her daughter, we will supplicate to Allah to make her in no need for her,\" i.e., to make the daughter in no need for her mother as the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would take care of her, or that she would find someone to take care of her from among her relatives, or that Allah will make her in no need for suckling from her mother, as the girl was an infant. \"and I will supplicate to Allah to make the jealousy go away.\" By virtue of the blessing of the Prophet's supplication, jealousy went away from her heart, and the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) married her.\nIn the Had\u012bth: We are enjoined to endure afflictions patiently and avoid despondency.\nAnd in it: We should turn to Allah with supplication at the time of disasters, for the compensation comes from Him.\nAnd in it: A believer must comply with the Prophet's commands, even if the wisdom behind them is not clear to him.."}, {"number": 309, "hadith": "\u2019Umm Salamah reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  When you visit a sick or dead person, say good things, for the angels say \"Amen\" to whatever you say.

The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) justified this saying that the angels who are present with the afflicted person - like the angel of death and his aids, or other angels in general - say \"Amen\" to whatever is said by the people who are present. They say: \u0100m\u012bn, which means: O Allah, answer the supplication. The angels' supplication is readily answered; hence, one must not supplicate with something that could harm him or others.\nThen, \u2019Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that when her husband Abu Salamah (may Allah be pleased with him) died - and he was her husband before the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) - she went to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and informed him of the death of her husband Abu Salamah (may Allah be pleased with him) expressing her pain and grief about him, not telling the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) of her husband's death, for it was reported in Sah\u012bh Muslim Collection that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) attended the death of Abu Salamah (may Allah be pleased with him).\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) guided and advised her to supplicate Allah, resign to Him, and ask Him for a compensation better than him by saying: \"O Allah, forgive me and him,\" asking forgiveness for her sins and those of her departed one. \"And compensate me with someone better than him,\" i.e., grant me a good compensation and a better substitute. She then reported that Allah Almighty answered her supplication and granted her a better substitute, as the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) married her.\nThe Had\u012bth clarifies that the angels are present with the sick person and say \"Amen\" to whatever supplication is made by people therein.."}, {"number": 310, "hadith": "\u2019Umm Salamah reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) entered upon Abu Salamah while his eyes were fixedly open, so he closed them and then said: When the soul is taken away, the sight follows it. Some people from his family clamored, so he said: Do not supplicate for yourselves except with what is good, for the angels say \"Amen\" to whatever you say. Then, he added: O Allah, forgive Abu Salamah and raise his degree among rightly guided people, be his successor in his descendants who remain. Forgive us and him, O Lord of the worlds, make his grave spacious for him and grant him light therein. [Another version quoted]: a similar Had\u012bth; however, he said: Be his successor in his legacy; and he said: O Allah, make his grave wide for him, and did not say: Make his grave spacious for him..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was a teacher and a mentor as he used to teach Muslims and educate them on adopting patience during the calamity of a close or a dear person's death. He taught us what to say, what supplication to recite, and how we should avoid screaming and indecent words when someone is dying.\nThis Had\u012bth represents a practical incident, as the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was there with Abu Salamah \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Abd al-Asad al-Makhz\u016bmi (may Allah be pleased with him) when he was on his deathbed. \u2019Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) - the wife of Abu Salamah at that time - narrates that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) entered upon Abu Salamah (may Allah be pleased with him) - as it was the Prophet's habit to visit the sick - \"while his eyes were fixedly open,\" i.e., his eyes were kept wide open after his soul had departed to its Creator, and he remained with his eyes fixed. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), thus, realized that he had died. So, he closed Abu Salamah's eyes to avoid appearing ugly. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"When the soul is taken away, the sight follows it.\" Perhaps this was the cause for closing his eyes as if he was saying: I closed his eyes because when the soul leaves the body, the sight follows it in leaving, so it is useless to keep his eyes open, or it could be a clarification of the cause why his eyes were open. When the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) closed the eyes of Abu Salamah (may Allah be pleased with him) and made that statement, the attendees became certain about his death. \"Some people from his family clamored,\" i.e., some people from Abu Salamah's family cried loudly and wailed. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade them from saying anything indecent and ordered them to say what is good and supplicate with what is good, and said: \"Do not supplicate for yourselves except with what is good.\" This refers to forbidding them from clamoring as if they said: O woe to us! What a disaster! So, he forbade them from this, not crying out for destruction, death, and similar things, which was a pre-Islamic practice; rather, saying good things like invoking forgiveness and mercy upon the dead person and saying the Prophet's supplication, which will be mentioned later, for Abu Salamah. Moreover, one should supplicate for himself with what is good and say what the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) advised us to say: \"All\u0101humma ajirni fi mus\u012bbati wakhluf li khayran minha (O Allah, reward me for my calamity and give me something better in place of it), after saying: We belong to Allah, and to Him we will return.\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) justified this by saying that the angels say \"Amen\" to supplication, whether for good or evil. They say: \u0100m\u012bn (O Allah, answer this supplication), which is likely to make the supplication accepted as the angels' supplication is undoubtedly answered. Hence, it is not permissible to supplicate for what could bring him or others any harm. What is meant by the \"angels\" here is the Angel of death and his aids, or the angels in general who are present when someone is dying. This is part of how the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) disciplines and teaches his Ummah what to say when someone dies.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) supplicated for Abu Salamah saying: \"O Allah, forgive Abu Salamah,\" i.e., erase his sins and misdeeds. \"And raise his degree among those who are rightly guided,\" i.e., O Allah, let him be with those whom You have previously guided to Islam and to emigrate to the best among people; or it means: O Allah, let him be with those whom You have guided and who obtained the high degrees in Paradise. And \" be his successor in his descendants,\" i.e., be his successor in managing his affairs and maintaining the interests of his family and children and do not leave them to anyone but You. Another version reads: \"Be his successor in his legacy,\" which he left behind after his death, \"who remain,\" i.e., who remain among the living. \"And make his grave spacious for him,\" which was interpreted by the version that reads: \"O Allah, make his grave wide for him,\" i.e., make his grave extremely wide, which is part of the believer's delight in the grave since the grave is either widened or narrowed for its dweller. \"And grant him light therein,\" i.e., in his grave and ward off the darkness from him, which is another aspect of the bliss that the believer experiences.\nThe Had\u012bth shows that the dead person's eyes should be closed.\nIt also guides to adopt patience and say what is good when the calamity of death strikes.\nIt also clarifies that supplication should be made for the dead person, his family, and his descendants concerning the Hereafter and worldly affairs.\nIt also signifies that the dead person finds joy or torment in his grave.\nMoreover, it teaches what Dhikr (remembrance of Allah) and supplication should be said at the moment of dying, saying what is good and making Istirj\u0101 ', which is saying: Inna lill\u0101hi wa inna ilayhi r\u0101j\u2018\u016bn (We belong to Allah, and Him we will return), besides supplicating for whoever will succeed him. So, it is a must to follow the Prophet's example.\nIt also points out the presence of angels with the sick and dead person and that they say \"Amen\" to whatever supplication is made therein.\nFinally, it clarifies that the angels' supplication is answered and not rejected.."}, {"number": 311, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Did you not see when a person dies, his eyes become fixedly open?\" They said: 'Yes.' He said: \"This is when his eyesight follows his soul.\".", "commentary": "This Had\u012bth contains clarification and explanation by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) about a general condition, namely the staring of the eyes of dying people after the departure of their souls. In explanation of this condition, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said that the eyesight follows the soul. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them): \"Did you not see when a person dies, his eyes become fixedly open?\" i.e., his eyesight goes upwards and does not turn back, and it remains open and wide. This question denotes affirmation of the condition that people know to happen upon death. They replied to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) that this is what actually occurs. So, he said: \"This is when his eyesight follows his soul,\" i.e., he looks at his soul as it ascends to heaven with the angels. Muslim narrated in his Sah\u012bh Collection that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came to Abu Salamah while his eyes were fixedly open, and he closed them. This is to prevent the appearance of the deceased person from turning ugly. So, his eyes must be closed after the departure of the soul, as the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) closed the eyes of Abu Salamah.."}, {"number": 312, "hadith": "\u2019Umm Salamah reported:  When Abu Salamah died, I said: A stranger and in a strange land, I shall, indeed, weep for him in a manner which would be talked of. I was prepared to weep for him when a woman from the Sa\u2018\u012bd (upper side of the city) came intending to assist me. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) received her and said: Do you want to let the devil enter a house from which Allah has driven him out?! Twice. So, I stopped weeping and did not weep..", "commentary": "This Had\u012bth shows how the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) disciplined and taught his Ummah and how keen he was on keeping Muslims away from the devil's temptation, especially when being stricken by the calamity of the death of a relative or a dear and precious person. The Mother of the Believers \u2019Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrates that \"when Abu Salamah died\", i.e., 'Abdullah ibn' Abd al-Asad al-Makhz\u016bmi (may Allah be pleased with him), who was her first husband and who emigrated from Makkah to Mad\u012bnah,' Umm Salamah said to herself: \"A stranger and in a strange land,\" i.e., he was from the people of Makkah and died in Mad\u012bnah as a stranger far from his relatives and homeland and having none to weep for him except her, so, there were two calamities: that of being far away from one's country and that of death. She intended this sentence to justify the act of weeping copiously. Hence, she swore to weep and wail for him in such an intense manner that would cause people to talk about it and wonder at it because of its intensity. Such were her thoughts because wailing and gathering for that purpose was a pre-Islamic practice, and that was before she learned that wailing is prohibited. Then, \u2019Umm Salamah reported that she was prepared and ready to cry by having the intention and the determination to do so and preparing the causes of grief, and meanwhile, a woman who wanted to assist her, i.e., assist her with weeping and wailing, came. This woman who wanted to help' Umm Salamah was from the \"Sa\u2018\u012bd\" in the 'Aw\u0101li region of Mad\u012bnah. \"Sa\u2018\u012bd\" originally meant the dust on the earth's surface. The 'Aw\u0101li today is the region located in the eastern and south-eastern sides of Mad\u012bnah on a line extending from Baq\u012b 'to Harrat W\u0101qim eastwards and parallel to Qub\u0101' Mosque southwards.\nThe Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), thus, received this woman to advise her and forbid her from doing this. After knowing what she intended to do, he said to her: O woman, do you want by your help with the sin to be a cause for letting the devil enter with his actions and deception, which Allah has driven him out and has kept him far from tempting its dwellers?! The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) repeated his advice for the woman twice to confirm such a prohibition. Another probable meaning is: He drove the devil out of this house and kept him far from tempting its dwellers twice, referring by \"twice\" to the act of soundly embracing Islam by Abu Salamah and his good act of emigration. Or the first time could be referring to the day he embraced Islam, and the second time refers to the day he left this world as a Muslim. Another probability is intending the repetition, i.e., Allah has driven him out time and again, as Allah Almighty says: {Then look again and again.} [Surat al-Mulk: 4] It is also said: Perhaps the first time refers to his emigration from Makkah to Abyssinia and the second time refers to his emigration to Mad\u012bnah, as he is one of those who made the two emigrations.\nThis is a manifestation of the Prophet's good education and discipline of his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), as he clarified to the woman that if she did that, she would let the devil enter a house from which Allah has driven him out, and this is a serious harm and an evil act. Moreover, he did not just forbid her; instead, he explained to her the disadvantages of this evil act and the resulting damages, harms, and punishments, which makes it more likely to be accepted.\nOn hearing the Prophet's words,' Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) was deterred from crying and stopped. She refrained from crying in such a dispraised manner, accompanied by lamenting and wailing.\nThe Had\u012bth shows that weeping for the dead accompanied by wailing is from the devil's acts.\nIt also points out how a Muslim must comply with the commands and prohibitions of the Shariah once he knows them.\nIt also clarifies that assistance in wailing is counted as assistance in sin.\nMoreover, it sheds light on the merit of the house of Abu Salamah and \u2019Umm Salamah, as Allah Almighty has driven the devil out from it, and he could not overpower them through temptation and misguidance.\nAs it shows that forbidding evil should be carried out wisely by clarifying the harmful consequences.."}, {"number": 313, "hadith": "\u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Umar reported:  We were sitting with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) when a man from the Ans\u0101r (Supporters) came and greeted him.

He was keen on establishing good relations among Muslims through visits and communication, especially visiting the sick. 'Abdullah ibn' Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) narrates that some of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) were sitting with the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and this was the Companions' habit with the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), i.e., gathering around him to teach and guide them. During this session, a man from the Ans\u0101r - people of Mad\u012bnah - came to him and greeted the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and those who were present, which is the etiquette of Islam in extending the greeting of peace to all. After greeting the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), the Ans\u0101ri man wanted to leave. So, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said in a pleasant way: \"O brother of the Ans\u0101r, how is my brother Sa\u2018d ibn \u2018Ub\u0101dah?\" Sa'd (may Allah be pleased with him) was the chief of the Khazraj, and he was sick then. Here, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was teaching Muslims to ask after each other in case of being absent or falling sick. His saying: \"O brother of the Ans\u0101r\", is a call by the brotherhood of Islam and a call for the man to show that he was from the Ans\u0101r, besides the act of honoring Sa'd ibn' Ub\u0101dah as the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) called him: \"My brother\". Answering the Prophet's question, the man said: He is \"good,\" i.e., no worry about him, as he is still alive and is likely to recover from his sickness, which is a polite thing to say and is said as a form of being optimistic that the patient will recover and be healthy once again.\nThereupon, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) encouraged his Companions to visit him, saying: \"Who among you would visit him?\" This was how the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) practically taught Muslims, as he got up along with his Companions to visit Sa'd ibn' Ub\u0101dah (may Allah be pleased with him), and they were \"bid'at 'ashr\" (more than ten), and \"bid '\" is: from three to ten. At this time, those who were present from among the Companions were suffering from indigence and poverty to the extent that 'Abdullah ibn' Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"We were wearing neither Ni\u2018\u0101l (shoes)\", plural of \"Na\u2018l\", which is the shoe, \"nor Khif\u0101f (leather socks)\", plural of \"Khuff\", which is  footwear made of thin leather. In other words, they had nothing to wear on their feet. \"Nor Qal\u0101nis (caps)\", plural of \"Qalansuwah\", which is something worn on the head, \"nor Qumus (shirts)\", plural of \"Qam\u012bs\", which is a sewn undergarment having two sleeves, or that which is made either of cotton or linen and this means that they were wearing Iz\u0101r (lower garment) and Rid\u0101' (upper garment). They went walking on foot to the house of Sa'd ibn' Ub\u0101dah (may Allah be pleased with him) \"on such swampy ground,\" which is the earth that is highly saline and nothing grows therein except some trees, i.e., they were wearing nothing on their feet to protect them from the harm of such ground. When the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) reached the house of Sa\u2018d (may Allah be pleased with him), Sa\u2018d's people, family, and kinfolk moved from around him to give the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessing be upon him) and his Companions who came to visit him the chance to proceed and get close to him, which is part of the visit etiquettes and honoring guests.\nThe Had\u012bth encourages asking after the absent and the sick and shows how the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to ask after his Companions.\nIt prompts us to visit the sick and communicate with them.\nIt points out the indigence and poverty of some of the Companions and how far they were from lavish in their clothes and their appearance.\nIt sheds light on honoring the guest who comes to visit by making room for him.\nIt shows that whoever has no shoes may walk barefoot.."}, {"number": 314, "hadith": "[Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s reported:]  So, I stood up and entered upon \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah and informed her of what Ibn \u2018Umar had said.

A Jew's funeral passed before the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and they were weeping over him. So, he said: You are weeping, and he is being punished..", "commentary": "No matter how grave it is, every calamity includes a reward for whoever patiently endures its severity, and the same applies to the catastrophe of death that entails losing people and dear ones. One of the habits of the pre-Islamic era of ignorance was to request in one's will that people should weep and wail over his death in opposition to all traditions and revealed laws. Islam has, indeed, forbidden this and has threatened to punish the one who does this deliberately and persistently. It has clarified that such an act brings pain and torment to the one who makes a will with it or approves it.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i \u2018Urwah ibn az-Zubayr reports that it was mentioned to \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) said: \"The dead person is punished because of his family's weeping over him,\" i.e., he is punished in his grave because those who are alive from among his family are weeping over him, besides doing other things of the pre-Islamic habits. A group of scholars interpreted this to be referring to whoever makes a will with it, or if this is their habit, and he does not forbid them by advising them before his death not to say or do something evil. This was a famous practice among the Arabs. So, if one thinks they will likely do this and does not advise them to refrain from it, then he is asking them to do it, and he becomes like one who does not forbid evil despite having the ability to do so. However, if he advises them to refrain from such an act and they disobey him, then Allah is far more Generous to punish him for that.\nUpon hearing this, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: \"May Allah have mercy upon Abu \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n, he heard something but did not memorize it,\" because this Had\u012bth had a reason and it was not as understood by Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father), or he mistakenly thought the Had\u012bth to have a general indication including all the dead people. Therefore, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported the reason behind this Had\u012bth, saying: \"A Jew's funeral passed before the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him)\", and his family members were weeping over him. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"You are weeping\" after his death, addressing the dead person's family, \"and he is being punished\". An agreed-upon version reads: Thereupon, she said: \"He missed the point; the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had only said: Indeed, he is punished for his sins and misdeeds, and his family members are weeping over him right now,\" i.e., his family members are weeping over him while he is being punished for his sins. So, the reason for his punishment is not his family's weeping over him; rather, it is his misdeeds and sins.\nAllah Almighty says: {No bearer of burden will bear the burden of another.} [Surat al-An\u2018\u0101m: 164] This means: no soul bears the sin of another soul.\nThe Had\u012bth highlights the status of \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) in terms of understanding and knowledge.\nIt also corrects the wrong concepts that some people have by using evidence and means of persuasion.."}, {"number": 316, "hadith": "Abu M\u0101lik al-Ash\u2018ari reported that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  Four in my Ummah are among the affairs of the pre-Islamic era of ignorance that have not been abandoned: boasting of noble ancestries, defaming lineages, seeking rain from the stars, and wailing. And he said: If the wailing woman does not repent before her death, she will be made to stand on the Day of Judgment wearing a garment of pitch and a chemise of mange..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was keen on bringing his Ummah out from J\u0101hiliyyah (pre-Islamic era of ignorance) with all its evils, sins, and polytheism to Islam and its laws with all its goodness and monotheism.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) depicts matters that were and are still practiced by some people, and such matters belong to the people of J\u0101hiliyyah. So, he warned us against them and pointed out that whoever adopts any of such matters is, in fact, adopting one of the pre-Islamic traits and must abandon it and adhere instead to what has been legislated by Islam concerning such a trait and its likes. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) reports that four characteristics exist in the Ummah of Islam that are from the affairs and usual attributes of the people of J\u0101hiliyyah. He said that such traits would last in the Ummah and would not be abandoned as other pre-Islamic practices have been abandoned, for if they are abandoned by one party, others will come and adhere to them.\nThe first thing of such matters: It is \"boasting of noble ancestries,\" which is taking pride in, bragging about, and exalting the characteristics, virtues, and bounties that are either in him or his family. \"Hasab\" (noble ancestry) refers to the personal traits one enumerates, such as bravery, eloquence, etc. \"Boasting of noble ancestries\" means acting arrogantly and loftily by enumerating one's virtues and his forefathers' remarkable feats, which entails deeming oneself better than others and looking down upon them. In the version of Abu D\u0101w\u016bd, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Allah has removed from you the pride of J\u0101hiliyyah and its boastfulness about the ancestors. It is either a pious believer or a miserable sinner. People are the children of Adam, and Adam is from dust.\"\nThe second repugnant matter: \"Defaming lineages,\" which means finding fault with people's lineages like discrediting the lineage or negating one's attribution to his father, is a malicious claim because it results in dividing Muslims and causing turmoils and evils, besides slandering people.\nThe third matter is: It is \"seeking rain from the stars,\" which refers to supplicating and seeking water through rainfall by believing that the stars are the cause of such rain, as they used to say in the pre-Islamic era of ignorance: we have been given rain because of such-and-such star; whereas, having a belief that it is actually the cause for rainfall is disbelief. Rain is part of Allah's mercy towards His slaves and falls according to His decree. It is one of the things that Allah Almighty spoke about, saying: {Indeed, Allah has the knowledge of the Hour. He sends down the rain and knows what is in the wombs. No soul knows what it will do tomorrow, nor does any soul know in which land it will die. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.} [Surat Luqm\u0101n: 34]\nFourth matter: \"Wailing\" means weeping over the dead by shouting, screaming, expressing impatience, and enumerating the deceased person's traits and virtues by saying, for instance: Alas for the brave one! Alas, for the lion! Alas, for the mountain!\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) , warned the wailing women if they did not repent for wailing before their death, saying, \"If the wailing woman does not repent before\" the time of \"her death, she will be made to stand on the Day of Judgment,\" the wailing woman, who did not repent, will be made to stand and will be gathered among the standing people to be exposed on the Day of Judgment, as a recompense for her wailing, while wearing a garment of pitch, which is molten copper or paint used for painting. It is also said: that it is grease with which the scabby camel is rubbed to burn the mange, and its heat could reach the inside. \"And a chemise of mange,\" \"dir\u2018\" (chemise) is a kind of women's shirts, i.e., she will be wearing another chemise of mange. This means that all her skin will be scabious and will act like a chemise covering her skin and sticking to her the way a chemise covers and sticks to her. He restricted repentance to the time before death to make it known that one of the conditions of repentance is for the repentant to repent while having hopes that he will still live and might commit the act for which he is repenting. This is supported by what is mentioned in the Book of Allah: {However, repentance is not for those who commit evil deeds until death approaches one of them; he then says, \u201cNow I repent.\u201d} [Surat an-Nis\u0101\u2019: 18]\nSuch a punishment is for wailing and enumerating the dead person's merits because both acts involve objection to Allah's decree. As for crying out of sadness and mercy for the deceased person, there is nothing wrong with that, as the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"This is mercy that Allah has placed in the hearts of His slaves. Verily, Allah shows mercy to those of His slaves who are merciful.\" [Narrated by Al-Bukh\u0101ri and Muslim]\nThe Had\u012bth includes one of the signs of the Prophet's prophethood.\nIt warns against boasting of noble ancestries and against slandering lineages.\nIt calls for preserving people's honor and refraining from slander.\nIt clarifies the fact that one's value depends on his personality and deeds, not on his forefathers' feats.\nIt warns against wailing over the dead.\nIt emphasizes that rain comes from Allah Almighty, and the stars have nothing to do with it. So, water should be sought from none but the Creator and the Omnipotent, who can make the rainfall.."}, {"number": 317, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h reported: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) made a speech one day and mentioned a man from among his Companions who died and was shrouded in a shroud of bad quality and was buried at night. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) rebuked that a man should be buried at night until prayer was offered over him, except when one is forced to do that. And the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"When one of you shrouds his brother, he should make his shrouding good.\".", "commentary": "The burial of a Muslim is part of the honor granted to him by Allah Almighty. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) taught his Ummah how to take care of the dead Muslims, including washing, shrouding, burying, and following the funeral procession, as well as other duties and Sunnah acts.\nIn this Had\u012bth, J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) delivered a sermon to his Companions one day and admonished them. In his sermon, he mentioned a man from among his companions who died and was shrouded in a shroud that was unbelievably bad or not completely concealing; moreover, he was buried and put into his grave at night. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) rebuked, prohibited, and banned his Companions from repeating an act like this with their dead brother, given his rights upon them. This includes burial at night. Indeed, a dead person should be buried during the daytime so that a lot of people can offer prayer for him, more than the people who would pray for him at night, or so that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) could offer the prayer for him, which is another reason for those who died during his lifetime. This also means that the burial of a dead person should be delayed until the morning, if it is hoped that those who will bless him will join the prayer.\nAnd he clarified to them that burial at night should only occur in the case of necessity, like fearing that the body may decay. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"When one of you shrouds his brother, he should make his shrouding good.\" This is intended to direct, teach, and enjoin excellence in shrouding the dead. Excellence, however, does not mean extravagance or immoderation in choosing the shroud or that it should be expensive. Rather, the intended meaning is that it should be clean, pure, thick, concealing, and of the same type of clothing he mostly wore in his life, neither finer nor lower in quality.\nIn the Had\u012bth: We are enjoined to use a good shroud, without extravagance or stinginess.\nAnd in it: Demonstrating the Prophet's care about the conditions of his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) whether they were alive or dead."}, {"number": 318, "hadith": "\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah reported that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"No group of Muslims numbering a hundred offer the funeral prayer over a dead person, and all of them intercede for him, except that their intercession for him will be accepted.\".", "commentary": "The religion of Islam is a religion of bounty and abundant giving from Allah, as He made the Muslims intercessors for one another. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) urged that a Muslim should attend the funeral of his fellow Muslim and made that one of the rights due to the Muslims among themselves.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) says that if a Muslim dies and a group of Muslims numbering a hundred offer the funeral prayer for him, \"and all of them intercede for him,\" i.e., they ask Allah Almighty to pardon his sins and crimes and they supplicate for him, in such a case, people's intercession for him will be accepted and their supplication for him will be answered. But two conditions should be met here: First: Those who intercede for him should be sincere in their supplication and should ask Allah to forgive him. Second: They should be Muslims and numbering a hundred persons, and they should include no one who associates anything with Allah.\nOther Had\u012bths are reported with lesser than this number, such as forty or three rows. It was said: Informing that the intercession of forty people is accepted does not necessarily mean that the intercession of a lesser number is not accepted, and the same holds true for the number of forty people along with three rows. Hence, all Had\u012bths are applicable, and the intercession is valid with the lesser of two numbers, the three rows or forty persons.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Urging the increase of a group offering the funeral prayer, and they are required to reach this number, which is one of the requirements for salvation\nAnd in it: Those offering the funeral prayer for a dead person are intercessors for him.\nAnd in it: Stressing the significance of sincerity in supplicating for the dead.."}, {"number": 319, "hadith": "Kurayb, the freed slave of Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s, related from \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s that a son of his died in Qudayd - or in \u2018Usf\u0101n - and he said: \"O Kurayb, look and see how many people gathered for him.\" He said: I went out and found that people had gathered for him. I informed him about that, and he said: \"Do you think they are forty?\" He said: 'Yes.' He said: \"Bring him out, for indeed I heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say:  'No Muslim man dies, and forty men, who associate nothing with Allah, attend his funeral except that Allah will accept their intercession for him.'\".", "commentary": "The bounty and giving of Allah Almighty is great. He made the Muslims intercessors for one another, and the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) urged that a Muslim should attend the funeral of his fellow Muslims and rendered it one of the rights of Muslims upon one another.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Kurayb, the freed slave of \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s, relates that a son of \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) died, and he was present with him, \"in Qudayd\", a place of water between Makkah and Mad\u012bnah, which is located 150km away from Makkah and lies to its northeast, \"or in \u2018Usf\u0101n\", a town located 80km to the northwest of Makkah. These are two places close to Makkah. \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) ordered Kurayb to go out and tell him about the number of people who had gathered to attend his funeral procession and prayer. Kurayb went to see the people and then informed them about their gathering and number. Thereupon, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) said to him: \"Do you think?\" i.e., do you estimate their number to be forty men? Kurayb replied: 'Yes.' In the version by Ibn M\u0101jah, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s said: \"How many do you see? Forty?\" I said: \"No, they are more than that.\" So, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) asked those with him to bring the funeral of his son to the people gathered in the mosque to offer prayer for him and bury him. Then, he said: \"For indeed I heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say: 'No Muslim man dies and forty men... attend his funeral'\", praying and supplicating for him, and they believe in Allah and associate none with Him in worship. In the version by Ibn M\u0101jah: \"No forty believers intercede for a believer.\" intercession here means request. Those attending the funeral prayer ask Allah Almighty to pardon the sins of the deceased, \"except that Allah will accept their intercession for him\", i.e., He will accept their intercession for that dead Muslim, out of His grace and bounty, and forgive him.\nIt is required to increase the number of those who attend the funeral prayer as much as possible, and they are required to reach this number that entails success. This is conditional upon two things: First: They should be intercessors for him, i.e., sincere in supplicating and asking Allah's forgiveness. Second: They should be Muslims and include none who associates anything with Allah.\nOther reported Had\u012bths mention a different number, like one hundred or three rows. So, it is said that intercession by a hundred people will be accepted, but it does not necessarily mean that intercession by a lesser number will not be accepted. The same holds true for the forty men and the three rows. Hence, all the relevant Had\u012bths are applicable. Intercession is valid by the lesser of the two: by three rows or forty persons; this is because when Allah Almighty promises forgiveness two times in one sense, and one of them is easier than the other, it is His unchanging way that He does not decrease the promised bounty after that. Instead, He gives more out of his bounty and favor from Him toward His servants. It is also probable that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was informed about the acceptance of intercession by a hundred persons. He was informed about it, and then he was informed about the acceptance of intercession by forty persons and then by three rows, even if their number is lesser, yet he was informed about that.\nThe Had\u012bth mentions that those who attend the prayer for a dead person are intercessors for him.\nIt urges Muslims to attend the prayer for the deceased and increase the number of those who attend.."}, {"number": 320, "hadith": "\u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n ibn Abi Layla reported: Zayd used to make four Takbirs upon our funerals, and he once made five Takbirs.

This clearly manifests that Islam devotes attention to the funerals and burial of the dead and taking them to the graves and Barzakh (the period between death and resurrection), where they wait for the Day of Judgment.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i W\u0101qid ibn \u2018Amr ibn Sa\u2018d ibn Mu\u2018\u0101dh informs that the T\u0101bi\u2018i N\u0101fi\u2018 ibn Jubayr saw him while he was at a funeral - a term that refers to a deceased in a bier - and was standing for the funeral. Meanwhile, N\u0101fi\u2018 ibn Jubayr \"was sitting and waiting for the funeral to be placed\" in the grave. N\u0101fi\u2018 ibn Jubayr asked him why he was standing - a disapproving questioning. W\u0101qid ibn \u2018Amr answered him: that he was waiting for the funeral to take place, in accordance with the Had\u012bth in which Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"When you follow a funeral, do not sit down until it takes place.\" Narrated by Al-Bukh\u0101ri and Muslim. Explaining why he was sitting, N\u0101fi\u2018 responded to him with the Had\u012bth narrated by Mas\u2018\u016bd ibn al-Hakam from \u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib (may Allah be pleased with both of them), who reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would initially stand up for funerals but later abandoned standing and would sit down. \u2018Ali's words \"and then sat down\" may also mean that he would sit down after the funeral passed him by and went away from him.\nThe Had\u012bths reported on the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) standing and sitting for funerals, indicating that his sitting abrogated his standing.

Many supplications are reported from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), to be said in the funeral prayer. It is preferred that the praying person use these supplications that are reported from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). But there is nothing wrong if one says other supplications. Supplication for the deceased person is made after the third Takb\u012br; one should supplicate secretly with the best of what he can recall, yet he should be sincere in supplicating for the dead person.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Awf ibn M\u0101lik al-Ashja\u2018i (may Allah be pleased with him) informs that he attended a funeral prayer with the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and part of his supplication which \u2018Awf (may Allah be pleased with him) memorized is: \"O Allah, forgive him\" by blotting out the sins and misdeeds. \"and have mercy on him\" by accepting the acts of piety. \"Make him safe,\" i.e., avert unpleasant things from him and make him safe from the punishment. \"and pardon him,\" i.e., pardon the sins he committed and his shortcomings in the acts of worship. \"Make his Nuzul (welcome treat or gift) an honorable one.\" The word Nuzul originally means the food prepared for the guest. It here refers to what Allah gives to His servant when he meets Him and honors him therewith. \"broaden his entry,\" i.e., broaden the place of his entry in which he enters - that is his grave - lest it may become narrow for him. This is part of the bliss of the believer in the grave. The grave is either broadened for the one buried in it or made narrow for him. \"and wash him with water, snow, and hail.\" Hail is pellets of ice descending from the clouds of the sky, which means: Purify him from the sins and misdeeds thereby, just as these things are means of purification from uncleanness and dirt. He combined them for emphasis. In other words, purify him from sins by the various kinds of forgiveness. He mentioned snow and hail because they are cold, and he mentioned water because it cleans, whereas the punishment for sins is hot. So, it was appropriate to mention snow along with water. Thus, water will do the cleaning, and snow and hail will do the cooling. \"and cleanse him of sins.\" This is a supplication for cleansing in the sense of purification from sins, as a white garment is cleansed of dirt. Thus, what is conceived is compared to what is perceived. This affirms what is mentioned before and is meant to emphasize purification from sins and misdeeds. \"Give him in exchange a home better than his home,\" i.e., compensate him and give him palaces or a vast grave that is better than his house in this transient world. And give him in exchange \"a family better than his family,\" those who are his relatives in the world, such as his mother, maternal aunt, daughters, father, son, and the like. The wife is excluded from this, as he singled her out after that. It was also said: Family here refers to servants. \"and a spouse better than his spouse,\" i.e., give him a wife from the houris (H\u016br al-\u2018\u012an) or from the women of the world in Paradise. It was also said: The exchange of family and wife means the exchange of traits, not people. \"Admit him into Paradise.\" This is a supplication for him to enter Paradise directly, without prior punishment. \"and protect him from the punishment of the grave\" after he enters it. Or he said: \"Protect him from the punishment of Hellfire\" in the Hereafter.\n\u2018Awf ibn M\u0101lik (may Allah be pleased with him) added that after hearing this supplication from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), he wished he had been that deceased person, given the great reward and forgiveness entailed by this supplication for him, and so as to reap benefit of the Prophet's supplication, for the Prophet's prayer and supplication are more likely to be accepted and materialized than others.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Supplication in the funeral prayer, which is the most important part of its objective\nAnd in it: Establishing the existence of the punishment of the grave."}, {"number": 323, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn Samurah reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) offered the funeral prayer for Ibn ad-Dahd\u0101h.

In Arabic, \u2018Adhq means palm tree, and \u2018idhq means a branch in a palm tree.

He came and said: O \u2019Umm ad-Dahd\u0101h, go out, for I have lent it to my Almighty Lord. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Many are the heavy bunches in Paradise for Abu ad-Dahd\u0101h.\" Heavy here indicates that the bunches have abundant fruits.

The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) were extremely keen to follow this Prophetic guidance.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Thum\u0101mah ibn Shufayy relates that he was with the Companion Fad\u0101lah ibn \u2018Ubayd (may Allah be pleased with him) on an expedition \"in the land of the Romans, at R\u016bdis\" is a Greek island situated east of the Mediterranean Sea and located midway between the main Greek islands and Cyprus. R\u016bdis was conquered in 53 A.H., during the reign of Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah ibn Abi Sufy\u0101n (may Allah be pleased with him). A Muslim man from their companions passed away. So, Fad\u0101lah ibn \u2018Ubayd (may Allah be pleased with him) commanded that this man be buried. After the dust was thrown over him, he commanded that his grave be leveled and blotted out and that it should not be raised or prominent. Then, Fad\u0101lah said: \"I heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanding that it be leveled\" i.e., the grave should be leveled to the ground and not be raised a lot; rather, it should be raised as high as a hand span, and it should be flattened or embossed, which is more appropriate so that it can be recognized as a grave and thus be protected from being sat on or trodden.\nThe Had\u012bth contains the command that the graves should be leveled and not be raised above the ground.\nIt indicates that those killed in wars should be buried, and their corpses should not be left without concealment.."}, {"number": 327, "hadith": "Abu al-Hayy\u0101j Al-Asadi reported: \u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib said to me: \"Shall I not send you with the same instructions as the Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) sent me with? Do not leave any statue without blotting it out or any raised grave without leveling it.\" [In a version]: And he said: and any image without blotting it out..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was keen to remove anything that pointed to the traces of J\u0101hiliyyah, which included their keenness on extolling images, the dead, and the graves.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Abu al-Hayy\u0101j al-Asadi relates that \u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib (may Allah be pleased with him) said to him: Shall I not send you for something the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) sent me for, and appoint you as a leader in charge of that, as the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) appointed me as a leader in charge of it? The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ordered \u2018Ali not to leave any 'statue', i.e., an image of a living being, without eliminating and abolishing it, by cutting off its head, changing its face, and so on; and not to leave any raised grave without leveling it and making it like the surrounding area. Taswiyah (leveling) may also mean making it sound and compliant with the Shariah. Or it means: flattening, that it should not be raised a lot above the ground, but only as high as a hand span. It is more appropriate to make it flat or a saddle high. What is intended here is the grave upon which a structure is built, and it becomes raised, not the grave upon which sand, pebbles, or stones are placed for identification, so that no one should trample or sit on it, and there is no use in building over it; hence, it was prohibited.\nIn the Had\u012bth: The command to remove statues and idols\nAnd in it: The command to level raised graves\nAnd in it: Removing what is wrong with one's hand in case a person has authority or ability to do so."}, {"number": 328, "hadith": "J\u0101bir reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade plastering a grave, sitting on it, and building over it..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was the keenest among people on eliminating the traces of J\u0101hiliyyah, like building over the graves and raising them, for this involves a waste of money and boastfulness, as well as other things that do not befit the Hereafter and the state of death and decay. He was also keen on directing the Muslims to what shows honor for one another both in this life and after death.\nIn this Had\u012bth, J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) informs that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade \"plastering the grave.\" In a version by Muslim: \"It was forbidden to plaster the graves with gypsum,\" i.e., to build them with gypsum and paint them, for this involves veneration and immoderation. And he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade \"sitting on it,\" as this denotes disregard for the right of his fellow Muslim. In a Had\u012bth by Muslim, Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"It is better for one of you to sit on a live coal, which will burn his clothes and get to his skin than to sit on a grave!\" This is a stern warning and emphatic prohibition against sitting on a grave. And he forbade \"building over it.\" This probably means building over the very grave to raise it, or building around it, like constructing a tent, a mosque, or the like around the grave. Both are prohibited, for this belongs to the practices of the people of J\u0101hiliyyah and it involves a waste of money.\nSo, the prohibition mentioned in the Had\u012bth comprises two types: going to excess as well as neglect regarding the graves. The dead people should not be insulted by trampling and sitting on their graves, nor should people show them immoderate reverence by constructing a building there and extolling them in a way that leads to certain forbidden things and evils.."}, {"number": 329, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"It is better for one of you to sit on a live coal and it burns his clothes and gets to his skin than to sit on a grave.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was keen to direct the Muslims to what demonstrates honor among themselves, both in life and after death. So, in this Had\u012bth, he prohibited sitting on the graves and was vehement in this prohibition. He (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informed and warned that if a person sits on a piece of inflaming fire and this live coal burns his clothes and reaches his skin, which involves tremendous harm and severe pain, this burning of his clothing and skin is better and easier for him than sitting on a grave. This is a stern warning and emphatic prohibition from sitting on graves. He forbade sitting on graves because this constitutes belittlement of the rights of fellow Muslims, even if they are dead.\nThe usual practice regarding the graves is only to visit them and supplicate there while standing, as the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to do when he headed to the Baq\u012b' cemetery. He would say: \"Assal\u0101mu \u2018alaykum ahl ad-diy\u0101r min al-mu\u2019min\u012bn wa al-muslim\u012bn, wa inna in sh\u0101\u2019 Allah la l\u0101hiq\u016bn; as\u2019al Allah lana wa lakam al-\u2018\u0101fiyah\" (Peace be upon the dwellers of this place among the believers and Muslims.

So, he prohibited sitting on the graves, and he was vehement in this prohibition.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) says: \"Do not sit on the graves,\" for this shows disregard for the rights of fellow Muslims. In another Had\u012bth narrated by Muslim, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) stated that sitting on lively embers is better than sitting on the graves. The usual practice regarding the graves is to only visit them and supplicate there while standing, as the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to do when he headed to the Baq\u012b\u2018 cemetery. He would say: \"Peace be upon the dwellers of this place among the believers and Muslims. Indeed, we will join you, Allah Willing. I ask Allah for safety for us and you.\" [Narrated by Muslim] Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"and do not pray towards them,\" i.e., do not pray, facing the graves. This is to differ from the Jews and the Christians who used to take the graves of their prophets and righteous ones as places of worship, in exaltation of them. And they would probably do there things that are only due to the Creator, the Almighty Lord. This applies to praying upon the grave, towards it, or between two graves, for this leads to the exaltation of the graves and to worshiping them as was the practice during J\u0101hiliyyah. Excluded from this prohibition is the funeral prayer at the graves, as authentically reported from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\nIn the Had\u012bth: It is prohibited to sit on the graves.\nAnd in it: It is prohibited to pray at the graves, between them, or towards them.."}, {"number": 331, "hadith": "\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah reported: When Sa\u2018d ibn Abi Waqq\u0101s died, the wives of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) sent a message to bring his bier into the mosque so that they should offer prayer over him, which they did. It was placed in front of their rooms, and they offered prayer over him. It was brought out of the Door of Funerals, which was towards the side of Maq\u0101\u2018id, and news reached them that the people criticized that, saying: It is not appropriate for a bier to be taken into the mosque! This was conveyed to \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah, and she said: \"How quick people are in criticizing what they have no knowledge about! They criticized us that a bier should be brought into the mosque, whereas the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not offer prayer over Suhayl ibn Bayd\u0101\u2019 except deep inside the mosque.\".", "commentary": "The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) were the keenest among people on following the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and they would probably correct one another when it came to unclear matters or confusing to them.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Mother of the Believers \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) says when the Companion Sa\u2018d ibn Abi Waqq\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) died, and he passed away in his palace in the region of Al-\u2018Aq\u012bq, ten miles away from Mad\u012bnah, in 55 A.H., according to the famous view, and he was carried on the shoulders of men so as to be buried in the Baq\u012b\u2018, the graveyard of the people of Mad\u012bnah, which happened during the caliphate of Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah ibn Abi Sufy\u0101n (may Allah be pleased with him), and Maraw\u0101n ibn Al-Hakam was the then-governor of Mad\u012bnah. The Prophet's wives sent word to those who were carrying him and asked them to bring the bier - in reference to the deceased person - to the Prophet's Mosque so that the Mothers of the Believers, the Prophet's wives, could offer prayer over him. In a version by Muslim, it was \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who asked for that. The bier was brought into the mosque and placed in front of the rooms of the Mothers of the Believers, who offered the funeral prayer over him. After the prayer was finished, he was taken out of the Door of Funerals, i.e., the door of the mosque that was prepared for the passing of funerals; or because the funerals would often pass through this door - given its closeness to the direction of the Baq\u012b\u2018 - it was called as such. It was located near \"the Maq\u0101\u2018id\", which was situated behind the eastern wall of the Prophet's Mosque, east of the noble chamber, where the Im\u0101m would stand up to offer the funeral prayer, the Prophet's grave would lay to his right. It was said: \"The Maq\u0101\u2018id\" is a place at the door of the mosque reserved for sitting for the fulfillment of needs, performing ablution, and taking rest. And it was said: It was a stone near the house of \u2018Uthm\u0101n (may Allah be pleased with him) upon which he used to sit. It was also said: It was stairs. News reached \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the people criticized the entry of the bier into the mosque for the funeral prayer. That is because they would usually offer the funeral prayer outside the mosque, in an open space. Thereupon, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah said in wonder: \"How quickly people are criticizing what they have no knowledge about!\" i.e., how quickly they forgot the Sunnah. It was said: How quick they are in maligning and finding faults. It was also said: How quick they are in denying what they do not know, namely the ruling on bringing the bier into the mosque. Therefore, they criticized us for bringing the bier into the mosque. Then, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) cited the Prophet's action as evidence, saying: \"Whereas the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not offer prayer for Suhayl ibn Bayd\u0101,\u2019\" i.e., for his funeral. Suhayl (may Allah be pleased with him) was one of those who engaged in the two immigrations\u2014to Abyssinia and Madinah\u2014and he participated in the battles of Badr and \u2019Uhud. He (may Allah be pleased with him) died after the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) returned from the battle of Tabuk, 9 A.H. \"except deep inside the mosque\" and within it. This proves that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did offer the funeral prayer in the mosque, even if a few times, but this points to permissibility.\nIn the Had\u012bth: The merit of the knowledge of \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her)\nAnd in it: Offering the funeral prayers inside the mosque and outside it\nAnd in it: Offering the funeral prayer by women\nAnd in it: The Sunnah should not be abandoned because some people deny it out of ignorance; rather, it should be demonstrated to the people and taught to those who are ignorant about it.."}, {"number": 332, "hadith": "\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah reported, saying: \"Should I not tell you about the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and me?\" We said: 'Yes.'

Then, he spread the end of his Iz\u0101r (lower garment) on his bed and lay down until he thought that I had gone asleep. He took hold of his mantle slowly and put on his shoes slowly, and opened the door and went out and then closed it gently. I put on my head cover and my veil and tightened my Iz\u0101r, and then went out following his steps until he reached the Baq\u012b\u2018. He stood there for a long time. He then lifted his hands three times, and then returned and I also returned. He hastened his steps, and I also hastened my steps. He ran and I ran too. He came (to the house), and I also came (to the house). I, however, preceded him and entered (the house), and as I lay down in bed, he entered and said: 'What is the matter with you, O \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah; you are out of breath and your abdomen is heightened?' I said: 'Nothing.' He said: 'Either you tell me or the Gentle and the All-Aware will inform me.' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be redeemed for you.' Then, I told him everything. He said: 'So, you were the darkness that I saw in front of me?' I said: 'Yes.' He struck me on the chest, and it was painful, and he then said: 'Did you think that Allah and His Messenger would be unfair to you?' I said: 'Whatever people conceal, Allah knows it. Yes.' He said: 'Jibr\u012bl came to me when you saw me. He called me and he concealed it from you. I responded to his call, but I too concealed it from you, as he would never come to you while you are undressed. I thought that you had gone asleep, and I did not like to awaken you, fearing that you might be afraid of being left alone. Jibr\u012bl said to me: 'Your Lord commands you to go to the inhabitants of the Baq\u012b\u2018 and seek forgiveness for them.'\u2019 I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, what should I say to them?'

He used to supplicate for the Muslims while they were alive and dead, and he would teach those who asked what was beneficial to them. His wives (may Allah be pleased with them) were among the people with the most knowledge of his conditions at home.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Muhammad ibn Qays ibn Makhramah ibn al-Muttalib relates that he heard the Mother of the Believers \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrate to the people one day about some situation between her and the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). In an exciting manner, she said to those around her: \"Should I not tell you about the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and me?\" i.e., information related to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his Sunnah in his dwelling and house. People listened to her and replied in the affirmative that she should narrate to them, and in the same interesting manner in another version: Muhammad ibn Qays one day said to his companions: \"Should I not tell you about me and my mother?\" The people thought he meant his mother who had given birth to him. Yet, he meant our Prophet Muhammad (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and the Mother of the Believers \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), as Allah Almighty says: {The Prophet has a greater claim over the believers than their own selves, and his wives are their mothers.} [Surat al-Ahz\u0101b: 6] Then, he mentioned that she (may Allah be pleased with her) told him that when it was her night in which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would stay with her, he turned to his bed in which he would lie down. It was said: He departed from the mosque after the \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayer and turned back to his bed, took off his clothing and shoes, and placed them near his legs so that he could put them on when he got up to leave. He spread his Iz\u0101r - the garment that covers his lower body - over the bed and slept on it. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) lay down in bed to sleep, but he only remained in this state of lying down for as long as he thought that \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) had lain down and slept. He took his garment gently and calmly, lest she might get up from her sleep. And he wore his shoes, also in a calm and gentle way. He opened the door, went out of the house, and closed the door calmly and gently, without making a sound. He did all that in a subdued and calm manner out of compassion toward her, lest he awaken her, and thus he would leave her awake, and she might feel solitude and loneliness in the darkness of night.\n\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with him) sensed the departure of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and she wore her garment from above her head, covered her head with a veil, and used her Iz\u0101r as a cover whereby she concealed her face. Then, she went after the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to know where he was about to go. She found that he had left and headed towards the Baq\u012b\u2018, the graveyard of the people of Mad\u012bnah located on the eastern side of the Prophet's Mosque. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) stood up in the Baq\u012b\u2018 to supplicate for its people. He stood for a long time and then raised his hands supplicating for them three times. When a supplication is repeated, it is more likely to be accepted. After he had finished, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) left the Baq\u012b\u2018 and headed home. \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) left her place before she could be seen by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) quickened his steps, and so did \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her). He ran moderately at a pace faster than walking. So, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) jogged. Thereupon, he increased the intensity of his running, and \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) increased the intensity of her running as well.\n\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reached there ahead of him and entered the house. Once she lay down in her sleeping place, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) entered after her. He asked her: \"What is the matter with you, O \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah?!\" He called her name with a shortened form out of gentleness and cordiality. \"you are out of breath,\" which happens to a person when he walks fast or talks in a nervous way. \"and your abdomen is heightened?\" What is the reason behind the disturbance of your body and your breathlessness? She informed him that there was nothing in her that caused that. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to her: \"Either you tell me\" about the reason for your disturbance and breathlessness, \"or the Al-Lat\u012bf (the Gentle),\" the Compassionate towards His servants \"and the Al-Khab\u012br (the All-Aware)\" the Knower of their conditions, apparent and hidden \"will inform me\" about the reason for your disturbance and breathlessness. \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) replied: \"O Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be redeemed for you,\" may my parents be redeemed to protect you from any harm. She told him about the reason and that she walked after him to find out where he was going. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) understood and knew that she was the person he saw while returning. So, he said to her: \"So, you were the darkness,\" i.e., the person that I saw in front of me when I returned from the Baq\u012b\u2018? She said: Yes. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) pushed her hard, or struck her on her chest with his fist, causing pain to her. Then, he said to her: \"Did you think that Allah and His Messenger would be unfair to you?\" i.e., that Allah and His Messenger would wrong you. The meaning: Did you think that I have wronged you by giving you your day and turning to someone else? The mention of Allah is a preparation and prelude for the mention of His Messenger. He is not meant by the word 'unfairness'. His mention affords respect to the Messenger and indicates that the Messenger would not do anything without permission from Allah Almighty.\nConfirming the Prophet's statement, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: \"Whatever people conceal,\" i.e., anything a person conceals and hides from others, \"Allah knows it,\" for He is the One Who knows the innermost thoughts. This seems to be an acknowledgment by her of this thinking.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informed her about the reality of what he did and his leaving at that time, namely that Jibr\u012bl (peace be upon him), the angel in charge of the revelation, came to him when \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) saw the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) get up from his bed. So, Jibr\u012bl (peace be upon him) called out to him from outside the room and hid his call from \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) so that she would not hear it. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) answered him and responded to his call and hid his response from \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her). Then, he clarified to her the reason for this concealment, saying that Jibr\u012bl (peace be upon him) called out to him from outside the room because he would not enter the room of \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) when she was undressed. Also, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) told her that upon leaving, he thought that she had slept; so, he disliked awakening her and feared she might feel gloomy if he had left her awake alone in the darkness of the night.\nThen, when he went out to Jibr\u012bl (peace be upon him), he said to him: \"Your Lord commands you to go to the dwellers of the Baq\u012b\u2018 graveyard and seek forgiveness for them,\" i.e., supplicate and ask Allah Almighty to forgive their sins. Whereupon, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) asked: \"'O Messenger of Allah, what should I say to them\" if I want to visit them? This applies to the people of the graves in general. In other words: What dhikr and supplication should I say when I visit the graves? So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) taught her to say: \"Peace be upon the dwellers of these dwellings among the believers and Muslims;\" the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) called the place of the graves a dwelling and dwellings, for they are gathered therein like the living people in houses. \"May Allah have mercy upon those of us who went before,\" i.e., those who died before us. \"of us,\" the community of believers. \"and those who will go later,\" i.e., those who will die later, after us. \"and we will join you, Allah willing,\" in dying while being Muslims. His statement \"Allah willing\" does not denote doubt; rather, it was for seeking blessing and complying with Allah's command to him: {And never say about anything, \u201cI will surely do this tomorrow*,\" without adding: \"if Allah wills\"} to the rest of the verse. [Surat al-Kahf: 23-24]\nIn the Had\u012bth: Prolonging and repeating supplication\nAnd in it: Raising one's hands in supplication\nAnd in it: Supplication while standing is more perfect than supplication while sitting in the graveyards\nAnd in it: The Prophet's leniency and mercy\nAnd in it: What should be said upon entering the graveyards\nAnd in it: Greeting the dead is like greeting the living.\nAnd in it: Supplicating for Allah's mercy upon the living and the dead\nAnd in it: Demonstrating women's innate disposition of jealousy\nAnd in it: A husband disciplining his wife by striking her with his hand and the like, even if this causes pain to her\nAnd in it: Visiting the graves by women."}, {"number": 333, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah reported: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) visited the grave of his mother and wept and caused those around him to weep. Then, he said: \"I sought permission from my Lord to ask forgiveness for her, but I was not permitted, and I sought permission from Him to visit her grave, and I was permitted. So, visit the graves, for they remind of death.\".", "commentary": "Mentioning death and visiting the dead and the graves remind one of the Hereafter and the inevitable end for every human. This motivates one to work.

The grave of the Prophet's mother was in Al-Abw\u0101\u2019, located between Makkah and Mad\u012bnah, 67km away from R\u0101bigh, north of the region of Makkah. During J\u0101hiliyyah and the early period of Islam, it belonged to the dwellings of Banu Damrah, from the tribe of Kin\u0101nah. Today, it belongs to the dwellings of Banu \u2018Amr ibn Harb. This visit took place during the year of the Conquest of Makkah, 8 A.H. The reason behind the Prophet's visit to her grave was to seek strong admonition and reminder by watching her grave. This is supported by his statement at the end of the Had\u012bth: \"So, visit the graves, for they remind of death.\" It was said: The Prophet's visit to her grave, despite her being a disbeliever, was meant to teach the Ummah the rights due to one's parents and relatives. He did not fail to fulfill her rights although she was a disbeliever. When the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) saw the grave of his mother, he wept, and those around him wept for his weeping.\nSo, clarifying the reason for his weeping, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"I sought permission from my Lord to ask forgiveness for her\" - by supplicating for the pardon and elimination of sins - \"but I was not permitted\" because she was a disbeliever, and it is not permissible to ask for Allah's forgiveness for the disbelievers, for Allah will never forgive them. Allah Almighty says: {Allah does not forgive associating partners with Him but forgives anything less than that for whom He wills.} [Surat an-Nis\u0101\u2019: 48] The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said that he sought permission to visit the grave of his mother, and Allah Almighty permitted him to do that. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"So, visit the graves, for they,\" i.e., the graves or visiting the graves\" remind of death.\" Remembrance of death softens the believing hearts, particularly when it is associated with the meanings of elimination, resurrection, questioning, and standing before Allah.\nIn the Had\u012bth: It is prohibited to ask for Allah's forgiveness for anyone who dies in a religion other than Islam.\nAnd in it: Visiting non-Muslim parents\nAnd in it: Visiting the graves reminds of death and the Hereafter.\nAnd in it: Weeping during the visit to the graves."}, {"number": 334, "hadith": "Buraydah reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"I have forbidden you from receptacles; indeed, receptacles - or a receptacle - do not make something lawful or unlawful, and every intoxicant is unlawful.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was concerned about the Muslims and what served their interests and welfare, and he would probably enjoin something or prohibit it at a certain time and under certain circumstances for some purpose and then change the command or prohibition after the end of the circumstances for another purpose.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) says: \"I have forbidden you from receptacles,\" i.e., I have forbidden you before that from some receptacles and vessels which were used for keeping food and drink. These receptacles whose use was forbidden by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) include the following: Ad-Dubb\u0101\u2019: The pumpkin, after withering and becoming dry, is used as a receptacle. An-Naq\u012br: The hole and empty space made in the trunks of palm trees. Al-Muzaffat: What is smeared with the asphalt. Al-Hantam: The green jars among the pottery made of mud, blood, and hair. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade them to block the means to what is unlawful, lest intoxication may happen because of them, for these receptacles help in this process; so, the drink may turn into wine while they do not know, and thus they will fall into what Allah prohibited.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"indeed, receptacles - or a receptacle - do not make something lawful or unlawful.\" A receptacle is a container or vessel. The meaning: These vessels were not prohibited per se, but they were prohibited due to their effect on the drink placed therein, which hastens its transformation into wine. This indirectly indicates that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) permitted the use of these receptacles which he used to prohibit; but if what is in them turns into wine, it is prohibited to drink it.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"and every intoxicant is unlawful,\" i.e., the rule governing whether a vessel is lawful or unlawful is that every drink that covers the mind and causes its loss is unlawful. This statement by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) constitutes a key principle in prohibiting the consumption of all intoxicants that cover the mind, with all their different forms and types.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Demonstrating Islam's care about the soundness and attentiveness of the mind, for it is the basis of accountability.."}, {"number": 335, "hadith": "Buraydah reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"I forbade you from visiting graves, but you may visit them, and I forbade you from the meat of sacrificial animals after three days, but you may keep it as long as you wish, and I forbade you from wine except in a water-skin, but you may drink it from all kinds of water-skins, yet you must not drink anything intoxicating.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was concerned about the Muslims and what served their interests and welfare, and he would probably enjoin something or prohibit it at a particular time and under certain circumstances for some reason and then change the command or prohibition after the end of the circumstances for another reason.\nThis is one of the Had\u012bths that combine abrogating and abrogated rulings. He (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"I forbade you from visiting graves, but you may visit them,\" i.e., I earlier forbade you from visiting graves, for they were not too far from the era of J\u0101hiliyyah and the worship of idols and the supplication to idols. So, they were prohibited from visiting graves for fear they might say or do any of the things they used to say or do in J\u0101hiliyyah and for fear that this might be a means leading to the worship of those buried in the graves. But now Islam has become strong, and the foundations of polytheistic visits have been demolished. So, you may visit them, for this inspires softness of the heart, reminds of death and decay, etc., which prompts one to do good and prepare for this day.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informed that he had initially forbidden the Muslims to store the meat of sacrificial animals for more than three days. This prohibition was for the sake of the poor and needy who came to Mad\u012bnah when famine hit the desert. As a result, the desert dwellers entered Mad\u012bnah. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) prohibited the Muh\u0101jir\u016bn and the Ans\u0101r from storing the meat of sacrificial animals for more than three nights so that they should instead give to those poor and needy people. Then, he gave them the new command, saying: \"but you may keep it as long as you wish\" i.e., you may store their meat for the period you want. Or the intended meaning: Keep the meat that remains after you have given out what is due to the poor.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) told that he had earlier forbidden the Muslims from drinks prepared in certain containers. This refers to such sweet fruits as raisins, dried dates, figs, or others, that are soaked in water till they turn into wine. He excluded from those vessels the water-skin vessel, which is a leather container that does not make water hot; therefore, the drink does not become intoxicating in a short time. By contrast, other vessels make water hot and turn the drink into an intoxicant. Hence, he allowed them to consume drinks in any container, unless they become intoxicating. He said: \"But you may drink it from all kinds of water-skins, yet you must not drink anything intoxicating.\" The meaning: Drink all kinds of drinks put in vessels and containers, provided that the drink is not intoxicating. Consequently, what is prohibited is intoxicants, not the utensils or vessels themselves.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that a Muslim may store the meat of sacrificial animals for as long as he wishes.\nIt enjoins visiting graves for reminder and admonition.\nIt forbids the drinking of intoxicants.."}, {"number": 336, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn Samurah reported: A man who killed himself with a broad-headed arrow was brought to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), but he did not offer the funeral prayer for him..", "commentary": "The preservation of life is one of the supreme objectives of the Islamic Shariah, and killing a person unjustly is one of the gravest major sins. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was keen to deter the Muslim from killing himself.\nIn this Had\u012bth, J\u0101bir ibn Samurah (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that the bier of one of the Muslim men who had killed himself with a broad-headed arrow, was brought to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), but the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not offer the funeral prayer for him by himself, by way of deterring people from acting like the dead person. However, the Companions offered the funeral prayer for him. Likewise, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) initially refrained from offering the funeral prayer for a debtor, to deter them from taking borrowing lightly and neglecting repayment. He commanded his Companions to offer the funeral prayer for him. He (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Pray for your companion.\" Narrated by Al-Bukh\u0101ri and Muslim.\nIn the Had\u012bth: The graveness of killing people."}, {"number": 337, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"No Zakah is payable on the slave except Zakat al-Fitr.\".", "commentary": "Zakah is an obligation Allah Almighty ordained upon the rich to be given back to the poor. Allah Almighty and His Messenger (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) specified all details and rulings related to this obligation so that the rich would not be wronged and the poor's rights would not be lost.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) says: \"No Zakah is payable on the slave except Zakat al-Fitr\" i.e., Zakah on personal property is not payable on slaves and slavegirls who serve their owners and are not retained for trade; this is because Zakah is due upon growing wealth, which grows and increases by earning. As for slaves, they are used in the service of their masters and owners. As regards them, their owners either pay only Zakat al-Fitr on their behalf, which is a S\u0101\u2018 of food for each slave, or, in case they are slaves with whom their owner does business, he should pay Zakah on the commodities and profits of his trade, if they reach the Nis\u0101b (the minimum Zakatable amount) and witness the passage of one lunar year.\nThe Had\u012bth shows Allah's mercy toward His servants, as He pardoned the Zakah on slaves.."}, {"number": 338, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Any owner of gold or silver who does not pay what is due on them, on the Day of Resurrection, plates of fire will be heated for him in the fire of Hell, and his side, forehead, and back will be seared with them. When they cool down, they will be heated again and the same process will be repeated during a day the measure of which is fifty thousand years long until judgment is established among the slaves and he will see his path, either to Paradise or to Hellfire.\" It was said: \"O Messenger of Allah, what about camels?\" He said: \"Any owner of camels who does not pay what is due on them, and part of what is due on them is to milk them on the day they are taken to water, when the Day of Resurrection comes, he will be made to lie down on a vast smooth plain, and they (the camels) will come, more numerous than they have ever been without even a single young one missing thereof. They will trample him with their hooves and bite him with their mouths; as often as the first of them passes over him, the last of them will be made to return and pass over him in a day the measure of which is fifty thousand years, until judgment is established among the slaves and he sees his path, either to Paradise or to Hellfire.\" It was said: \"O Messenger of Allah, what about cows and sheep?\" He said: \"Any owner of cows or sheep who does not pay what is due on them, when the Day of Resurrection comes, he will be made to lie down on a vast smooth plain and they will come without any of them missing. There will be none among them with twisted horns, without horns, or with a broken horn; they will gore him with their horns and trample him with their hooves; as often as the first of them passes over him, the last of them will be made to return and pass over him in a day the measure of which is fifty thousand years, until judgment is established among the slaves and he will see his path, either to Paradise or to Hellfire.\" It was said: \"O Messenger of Allah, what about horses?\" He said: \"Horses are of three types: for a man they are a burden, for another man they are a shield, and for a third man they are a source of reward. The one for whom they are a burden is the person who rears them in order to show off, for vainglory, and to oppose the Muslims; so they are a burden for him. The one for whom they are a shield is the person who keeps them for the sake of Allah and then does not forget the right of Allah concerning their backs and their necks, and so they are a shield for him. The one for whom they bring reward is the person who keeps them in a meadow and pasture for the sake of Allah in order to be used for the interest of the people of Islam. Whatever they eat from that meadow or pasture will be recorded for him as good deeds, and even their dung and urine will be recorded for him as good deeds. They will not break their halter and prance a course or two except that Allah will record their hoof marks and their dung as good deeds for him. And their owner does not take them past a river from which they drink, though he did not intend thereby to quench their thirst, except that Allah will record for him the amount they drink as good deeds.\" It was said: \"O Messenger of Allah, what about donkeys?\" He said: \"Nothing has been revealed to me in regard to donkeys except this unique comprehensive verse: {So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it*. And whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it.} [Surat az-Zalzalah: 7-8]\".", "commentary": "Wealth is the adornment of worldly life. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) outlined the rights due on those who own ample wealth - of Zakah and charity - and demonstrated the merit and reward they will gain in return for that. He also clarified the punishment for those who do not fulfill these rights.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) says that anyone who owns wealth, including gold and silver, and hoards it without fulfilling the rights due on them, by paying the Zakah and fulfilling Allah's rights therein, this wealth will certainly take the form of plates of iron on the Day of Judgment. It was said: of the same metal he hoards; they will be heated in the fire of Hell and his side, forehead - alluding to his face - and back will be seared with them. They will be placed on his body to torment him. This accords with the verse that reads: {On the Day when their treasures will be heated up in the Fire of Hell, and their foreheads, sides and backs will be branded therewith. [They will be told]: \"This is what you hoarded for yourselves; so, taste [the punishment of] what you used to hoard.\"} [Surat at-Tawbah: 35] So, He made the gold, silver, and wealth the very things that will be heated up in the fire of Hell on the Day of Judgment. What they hoarded and withheld its rights will be kindled in Hellfire. When its heat becomes intense, it will be placed on their foreheads, sides, and backs, and it will be said to them, rebukingly: This is your wealth, which you collected but did not fulfill. So, taste the outcome and evil consequences of what you used to collect and not fulfill its rights.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) mentioned that whenever their heat subsides, they will be heated again, and he will be tormented therewith again. This is meant to point to the continuity and permanence of the punishment. This punishment will be inflicted upon him on the Day of Judgment, the measure of which is fifty thousand years, which is the length of the day of reckoning. He will continue to receive punishment for all this period until Allah judges between all humankind. Then, after this punishment, the owner of the wealth will know his fate and recompense. Either Allah will show mercy to him and admit him to Paradise, by His grace, or he will endure in the punishment of Hellfire as a just recompense for his evil deed.\nAfter demonstrating the condition and recompense of he who hoards gold and silver, the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) asked the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) about the wealth of camels as to what should be done with it and about the punishment of one who does not fulfill the right and Zakah due on it. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) warned camel owners about not paying the Zakah due on them and not giving charity from any wealth derived from them. Part of these rights concerning camels is to milk them and give charity from their milk, especially when they go to drink from the reservoirs of wells and the like, as camels drink every three or four days; so, their milk is to be given to those who need it or to the passers-by, and so on. This is because milking on this day is better for the she-camel and more kind to the needy. It was the habit of the poor and needy to come to that place where camels arrive for drinking, in order to take from their milk; so, if anyone does not fulfill these rights, his recompense on the Day of Judgment will be that he will be made to sit and lie down on his face before these camels, \"on a vast smooth plain,\" which will be broader for the camels, and so they will trample him without hindrance. The camels will come and be created again with a larger number than they were in his possession, and in the best condition, and they will come in their entirety, with none missing, even the young of the she-camel will come with them. \"They will trample him with their hooves and bite him with their mouths,\" i.e., they will walk over him. A hoof is like a foot for humans. Every time they walk and pass over him up until the last camel among them, they will return and pass over him beginning with the last camel, which will now be the first. This means that they will keep walking over him nonstop, on the Day of Judgment, the measure of which is fifty thousand years, until Allah judges between the slaves; and he will know his fate, either to Paradise or to Hellfire, like the former person, the owner of silver and gold.\nThe Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) asked the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) about the other types of wealth, namely cows and sheep, in case their owner does not fulfill their Shar\u2018i rights; what is his recompense? The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) told them that if any owner of cows or sheep does not give what is due on them, his recompense on the Day of Judgment will be that he will be made to sit and lie down on his face for these cows and sheep in a vast level place, which will be broader for the cows and sheep. So, they will come in their most complete number in worldly life; \"There will be none among them with twisted horns,\" i.e., none of the cows or sheep will have twisted horns; rather, their horns will be level and extended. So, they will be stronger and more severe in hitting; \"without horns,\" i.e., none of the cows or sheep will be without horns; rather, they will all have horns. And they will include no cow or sheep with broken horns. These animals will all walk upon their owner, hitting him with their horns and heads and trampling him with their hooves and feet. Hooves are the protruding bones at the tips of the feet of cows and sheep. Every time the first of them passes over him, the last of them will be made to return and pass over him on the Day of Judgment, the measure of which is fifty thousand years, until Allah judges between the slaves. And he will know his fate, either to Paradise or to Hellfire.\nSo, the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) asked the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): What should we do with horses, and what is due regarding them? In response, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Horses are of three types,\" i.e., their owners fall under three categories in terms of reward and recompense. First: \"for a man they are a burden,\" i.e., they bring him sins and misdeeds. Such is the man who keeps and raises them to show off among people by their substantial number, value, and good appearance, and by riding them. They may also be intended for hostility and war against the people of Islam and engaging in war against them. So, they incur burdens and sins for their owner. Second: \"for another man they are a shield,\" i.e., they shield him and make him in no need to beg people in this life. Such is the man who keeps, raises, and fosters them for charitable purposes for himself and for others. In a version by Al-Bukh\u0101ri: \"who keeps them for earning his living and to be free from asking others,\" like trading in them or utilizing them for his interests and the benefits of his land and so on, even if he does not offer them for Jihad in the cause of Allah and war; and he does not neglect the right of Allah in them; rather, he fulfills the rights due on him regarding them; one of these is to extend their benefits to people, by lending them to those who need them. Third: \"and for a third man they are a source of reward,\" i.e., they bring reward for their owner. Such is the one who devotes them for serving the people of Islam, spreading the religion, and conducting Jihad for His cause. Part of his preservation of them is that he fosters them \"in a meadow and pasture,\" i.e., in gardens and groves where they pasture and eat. Every time they eat or drink from that garden or grove, a reward is recorded for him with Allah Almighty and as many virtuous deeds as the number of dungs they excrete are recorded for him. Dung is the excrement and waste coming out of the abdomens of animals. This indicates the extreme keenness to count the reward, for if honorable deeds are recorded according to the number of dung and urine, so what about other things?!\nIt was said: Dung and urine are recorded as good deeds because the continuity of their lives lies in them, though their origin, before the transformation, mostly come from their owner's money.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) pointed out the additional rewards for their owners due to their foot marks and the movements they make. So, he said that \"they will not break their halter,\" i.e., any of their ropes; \"and prance a course or two,\" i.e., they run quickly, go off, and ascend a high land or a mountain or two; \"except that Allah will record their hoof marks,\" i.e., the number of their steps, \"and their dung as good deeds for him. And their owner does not take them past a river from which they drink, though he did not intend thereby to quench their thirst, except that Allah will record for him the amount they drink as good deeds.\" The intended meaning: All the times of their life and all their movements, eating, and drinking are recorded for their owner as rewards and good deeds, by the grace and bounty of Allah.\nThen, the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) asked him: What is due regarding the local donkeys which are used for ploughing and servicing the land? The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) replied that nothing was revealed to him about donkeys and what is due regarding them, \"except this unique comprehensive verse,\" i.e., it is unparalleled, and it contains all meanings of good and evil deeds, including the obligatory or supererogatory acts of worship. It is the words that read: {So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it. And whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it.} [Surat az-Zalzalah: 7-8] An atom is a small ant or fine dust that floats in the air and can be seen in light. The meaning: The effect of every deed, good or evil, even if it is so little, will be seen, and the person will be held accountable for it before Allah Almighty. So, if he helps someone to ride them, he will be rewarded, and if he rides them to commit a sin, he will be punished.\nIn the Had\u012bth: It intimidates and deters us from hoarding wealth and failing to give what is due to Allah therein.\nAnd in it: It demonstrates the harsh punishment for withholding the Zakah.\nAnd in it: It demonstrates the duty of paying Zakah on silver and gold, and on camels, cows, and sheep, with the relevant conditions.\nAnd in it: It shows the merit of horses and the goodness and blessings lying in their forelocks, if they are used for righteous purposes.\nAnd in it: It encourages the doing of good, no matter how small or light in weight it may be.."}, {"number": 339, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h al-Ans\u0101ri reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say:  \"There is no owner of camels who does not pay what is due on them except that they will come on the Day of Judgment with a greater number than they ever were, and he will be made to sit on a level expanse, and they will trample on him with their forelegs and hooves. And no owner of cows who does not pay what is due on them except that they will come on the Day of Judgment with a greater number than they ever were, and he will be made to sit on a level expanse, and they will gore him with their horns and trample him with their forelegs. And no owner of sheep who does not pay what is due on them except that they will come on the Day of Judgment with a greater number than they ever were, and he will be made to sit on a level expanse. They will gore him with their horns and trample him with their cloven hooves, and none among them will be without horns or with broken horns. And no owner of a treasure who does not pay its due on it except that his treasure will come on the Day of Judgment like a bald snake and will pursue him with its mouth open, and when it comes near him, he will run away from it, and it will call him: 'Take your treasure which you concealed, for I am in no need for it.' When he sees that there is no way out, he will put his hand in its mouth, and it will gnaw it like a he-camel.\" Abu az-Zubayr said: I heard \u2018Ubayd ibn \u2018Umayr say: A man said: \"O Messenger of Allah, what is due on camels?\" He said: \"Milking them near water, and lending their bucket, lending their males and their females, and providing them as a ride in the cause of Allah.\".", "commentary": "Wealth is the adornment of worldly life. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) outlined the rights obligatory for those with ample wealth - of Zakah and charity - and demonstrated the merit and reward they would gain in return. He also clarified the punishment for those who do not fulfill these rights.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) demonstrates to us that if anyone does not pay Zakah on the cattle he possesses, they will come on the Day of Judgment with a more significant number than they were in his ownership, for they may undergo different conditions with him; sometimes lean, sometimes fat, and occasionally young, and at other times old. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informed us that they would come in the best condition in which they were with their owner. If they are camels or cows and he does not pay the Zakah due on them, they would trample him with their legs and gore him with their horns, and the camels would hit him with their hooves. A hoof is the pliant part at the end of the foot of the camel. Such a man would be made to sit for them against his will. \"on a level expanse\" (in Arabic Q\u0101\u2018 Qarqar): Q\u0101\u2018: an area of level ground, and water from the sky goes over it and it holds it. Qarqar: is also a vast plain. This indicates that the place can hold any number of animals. So, all that he possessed would come to this place, and he would be punished with his wealth, which he did not pay what was due to Allah. Likewise, if they are sheep and he does not pay the Zakah due on them, they would gore him with their horns and trample him with their cloven hooves, which exist in cows, sheep, and antelopes, within their forelegs. These animals would come in their complete strength, and none of them would come without having horns or with broken horns.\nIf the person who withholds what is due on wealth is the owner of a treasure, which refers to a collected fortune inside the earth or above it, and he does not pay the Zakah on it, his treasure would come in the form of \"a bald snake\". When a snake is bald, i.e., with no hair on its head, this is due to its excessive poison and prolonged age, or this refers to a snake whose head turned white because of the poison. Allah would punish the owner of the treasure with this snake, which would pursue him with its mouth open. When the snake approached the punished person, he would flee and run away from it. Then, the snake would address the treasure owner, saying: \"Take your treasure which you concealed, for I do not need it.\" As this man saw that he had no way of escaping from this snake, he would extend his hand and enter it inside its mouth, and the snake would \"gnaw it\" - gnaw means: eating and chewing vigorously - \"like a he-camel\", given its powerful gnawing.\nThen, \u2018Ubayd ibn \u2018Umayr informs that a man asked the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): \"What is due on camels?\" i.e., the usual and customary right among the Arabs towards the poor and destitute, by way of solace and generosity. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said that camels should be milked upon coming to the water, and the poor people who are present should be given to drink from their milk. He associated milking with the place of water because it is easier for the poor to go to such places and this is kinder to cattle. It is also because their milk becomes abundant there. \"and lending their bucket\", which is to give their vessels, where they are milked, or they drink, to others so that they can utilize them in case of need; \"lending their males\", and in a version by Muslim: \"lending their males for breeding\"; this is when the male copulates with the female to make it pregnant - without taking a wage for that. \"and their females\"; Minhah, in Arabic, is an ewe or a she-camel. Its owner gives it to someone to drink from its milk and returns it when it ceases to flow. \"and providing them as a ride in the cause of Allah\", which is to give them to those who ride them in the battle to spread Allah's religion or for any charitable purpose. This version indicates that these four acts are obligatory. This Had\u012bth is probably taken to apply to the time of need, the duty of providing solace, and the state of necessity, as was the condition during the early phase of Islam. Thus, the Had\u012bth means that once these rights exist, become due, and are not fulfilled, this stern warning applies to the person who refrains from observing them.\nThe Had\u012bth mentions the punishment for those who do not pay Zakah.\nIt is enjoined to give Zakah on cattle.\nIt indicates that if a person does not show gratitude for a specific blessing and fulfill Allah's rights, it will cause misfortune and evil consequences for him on the Day of Judgment.\nIt is also indicated in the Had\u012bth that Allah Almighty will resurrect the very camels, cows, and sheep whose Zakah was not paid to punish those who withheld Zakah.."}, {"number": 340, "hadith": "Jar\u012br ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h reported:  Some people from among the Bedouins came to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and said: \"Some people from among the Zakah collectors come to us and treat us unjustly.\" Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Make your Zakah collectors pleased.\" Jar\u012br said: Ever since I heard this from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), no Zakah collector left me without being pleased with me..", "commentary": "Islam regulated the matters of the religion and demonstrated how to perform the obligations and pillars. This includes its clarification of the rulings of Zakah, how to collect it, and the relevant requirements and etiquettes, so that this obligation can be fulfilled with willing hearts.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Jar\u012br ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) informs that a group of Bedouins - those who live in the desert - came to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in Mad\u012bnah and said: \"Some people from among the Zakah collectors\"  who estimate people's wealth and take the due Zakah therefrom, \"come to us and treat us unjustly,\" i.e., they take more than the amount required of us. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Make your Zakah collectors pleased.\" This means: Make them pleased by giving what is due, treating them gently, and refraining from opposing them. In a version narrated by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd, they said: \"O Messenger of Allah, even if they wrong us?\" He said: \"Make your Zakah collectors pleased, even if you are wronged.\" This statement is based on the presumed occurrence of injustice, not on its actual occurrence, and on the fact that if the Zakah collectors act justly, this is for themselves, and if they act unjustly, it is against themselves; whereas the property owner can lodge a complaint or clarify to him that this is not due to you; rather, what is due to you is such and such.\nThen, Jar\u012br (may Allah be pleased with him) said that no Zakah collector had left him without being pleased with him, out of tolerance towards him and in compliance with the command of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\nMeanwhile, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ordered the Zakah collectors to refrain from injustice and to avoid the most precious items of people's property. In a Had\u012bth narrated by Al-Bukh\u0101ri and Muslim and reported by Mu\u2018\u0101dh (may Allah be pleased with him), he said to them: \"So, do not take the most precious items of their property. And beware of the supplication of the oppressed, for there is no barrier between it and Allah.\" Thus, both the Zakah collector and the Zakah payer should observe the limits set by Allah.\nIn the Had\u012bth: The necessity of paying the Zakah in all conditions.\nAnd in it: Pleasing the Zakah collectors by paying the Zakah willingly and avoiding procrastination in its estimation\nAnd in it: The keenness of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) to comply with the commands of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).."}, {"number": 341, "hadith": "Al-Ahnaf ibn Qays reported:  While I was in the company of a group from Quraysh, Abu Dharr passed by as he was saying: \"Give glad tidings to the hoarders of the wealth of branding in their backs that would come out of their sides, and branding from the direction of their napes that would come out of their foreheads.\" He said: Then, he turned aside and sat down. He said: I said: \"Who is this?\" They said: \"This is Abu Dharr.\" He said: I rose and went to him and said: \"What is the thing which I heard you say a while ago?\" He said: \"I only said something which I heard from their Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\" He said: I said: \"What do you say about this gift?\" He said: \"Take it, for indeed it is a help today. But if it is a price for your religion, leave it.\".", "commentary": "Lawfully earned money is a favor from Allah Almighty, and it includes rights to the beggar and the destitute, and due upon it is Zakah and charity, which purifies it, grows it, and increases its blessing. Some people, however, act stingily and hoard wealth; as a result, their wealth brings them evil consequences in this world and the Hereafter.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Al-Ahnaf ibn Qays informs that while he was in a group and company from Quraysh, in Mad\u012bnah, the Companion Abu Dharr al-Ghif\u0101ri (may Allah be pleased with him) passed by as he was saying: \"Give glad tidings to the hoarders of wealth of branding in their backs.\" Glad tidings are given about pleasant incidents. So, he said it mockingly. Hoarding refers to wealth whose Zakah was not paid. However, if its Zakah is paid, this is not deemed hoarding, whether the wealth is large or little. The punishment for the hoarders on the Day of Judgment is that their backs will be branded with something that will emerge from their sides, and they will be branded from the back side of their heads with something that will emerge from their foreheads.\nThen, after expressing these words, Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) went away, turned aside, and sat down. Thereupon, Al-Ahnaf asked: Who is this person who spoke earlier? They said: This is Abu Dharr, the Companion of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). So, Al-Ahnaf went to him and asked him: What is the meaning of the statement you made a short while ago? Is this your speech or something you heard from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him)? Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) informed him that he had heard what he said from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Then, Al-Ahnaf asked him: \"What do you say about this gift?\" i.e., what do you think about the gifts we receive from the caliphs and governors? It is as if Al-Ahnaf feared the warning uttered by Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) regarding those who hoard wealth and do not spend it in the way of Allah. Abu Dharr replied to him: \"Take it, for indeed it is a help today\" i.e., take it if it will help you fulfill your needs. However, if this gift is a bribe, so that you remain silent and do not criticize wrong acts and sell your religion, then leave it and do not take it if you cannot obtain it except in an unlawful way. Do not care about it, for the religion's soundness is more important than acquiring worldly gains.\nThe Had\u012bth demonstrates the stern warning to those who do not pay Zakah on their wealth.\nIt warns against gifts by the rulers if they cause people to be silent and not speak the truth, or buy their religion and consciences and make them speak falsehood.."}, {"number": 342, "hadith": "Thawb\u0101n reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"The most excellent Dinar (money) a man spends is the Dinar he spends on his dependents, and a Dinar he spends on his riding animal in the cause of Allah, and a Dinar he spends on his companions in the cause of Allah.\" Abu Qil\u0101bah said: He began with the dependents. Then, Abu Qil\u0101bah said: Who could obtain a greater reward than a man who spends on young dependents and saves them from want, or Allah benefits them through him and makes them self-sufficient?!.", "commentary": "Spending in the cause of Allah is one of the best areas of benevolence. Such spending has numerous forms that are valued based on their respective worth and preferred over one another according to the relevant conditions and circumstances.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) demonstrates forms and areas of spending and arranges them in accordance with the relevant conditions, if a number of areas of spending converge at the same time. He said that the Dinar entailing the greatest reward is the one a person spends on his dependents and those he is obliged to provide for, such as his wife, children, and servants, if he seeks the Countenance of Allah thereby. In a version of the Two Sah\u012bh Collections: \"When a Muslim spends on his family seeking reward for it (from Allah), it counts for him as charity.\" So, it clarifies that if he seeks a reward for it from Allah, it counts as charity for him. This is because spending money on them is a duty, and he incurs a sin if he neglects them. Therefore, this entails a greater reward than if he spends on people other than his dependents and forsakes his dependents. The word 'Dinar' here is general and it comprises all money used for spending, and this applies to the contemporary currencies with their different kinds.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) mentioned spending on a person's riding animal which is prepared for war in the cause of Allah. He said: \"and a Dinar he spends on his riding animal\" which is garrisoned \"in the cause of Allah,\" i.e., he prepared it to be ridden in battle and other similar endeavors. \"and a Dinar he spends on his companions\" while they are fighting \"in the cause of Allah;\" so, he spends on his comrades in battle. It was said: \"in the cause of Allah\" means every act of piety.\nAt the end of the Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Abu Qil\u0101bah \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn Zayd, the narrator of the Had\u012bth, said: \"He began with the dependents,\" i.e., the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) regarded a man's spending on his dependents as the worthiest of all spending. Then, Abu Qil\u0101bah said: \"Who could obtain a greater reward than a man who spends on young dependents and saves them from want, or Allah benefits them through him and makes them self-sufficient?!\" This is the opinion of Abu Qil\u0101bah regarding spending and the prioritization of the mentioned categories. He held that the best and most worthy spending is the one spent on young dependents and children who cannot earn their living. So, this spending saves them from begging people and makes them self-sufficient and away from humiliation and disgrace. This accords with a Had\u012bth narrated by Muslim, in which Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"and a Dinar you spend on your family; the greatest in reward is the one you spend on your family.\"\nThe Had\u012bth shows numerous areas of spending for benevolence, goodness, and charity.\nIt also demonstrates that spending on one's dependents is one of the greatest areas of spending.\nAs it indicates that spending on Jihad in the cause of Allah is one of the greatest areas of spending, such as preparing the equipment and men for Jihad.."}, {"number": 343, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"A Dinar you spend in the cause of Allah, a Dinar you spend on (freeing) a slave, a Dinar you give in charity to a needy person, and a Dinar you spend on your family; the greatest in reward is the one you spend on your family.\".", "commentary": "In this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) demonstrates the areas of spending and goodness, their varying rewards, and which of them should be given precedence over others in case of the inability to do all of them. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informs that the best spending is a Dinar you spend in the cause of Allah, i.e., in the battle, or in the general sense: in the way of goodness; a Dinar you spend to free someone from captivity or a slave from slavery; and a Dinar you spend on your family, like your wife and children and those you are obliged to spend on. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) points out that the greatest of all these types of spending in terms of reward is the Dinar you spend on your family, provided that one intends it for the sake of Allah Almighty. In a version in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections: \"When a Muslim spends on his family seeking reward for it (from Allah), it counts for him as charity.\" So, it clarifies that if he seeks a reward for it from Allah, it counts as charity for him.

Allah Almighty says: {Nor is there any blame on those who came to you asking you for mounts to take them along, and you said, \"I can find no mounts for you,\" they turned away with their eyes overflowing with tears out of grief that they had nothing to spend.} [Surat at-Tawbah: 92]\nIn this Had\u012bth, the noble Companion Abu Dharr al-Ghif\u0101ri (may Allah be pleased with him) says that a group of poor people from among the Prophet's Companions said to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): \"O Messenger of Allah, the wealthy people have taken all the rewards,\" i.e., people of great wealth exclusively obtain more reward from Allah Almighty and take it instead of us, by giving charity out of their money. \"They pray as we pray and fast as we fast, but they give charity from their excess wealth.\" This is a complaint driven by positive greed, not envy or objection to Allah Almighty. They, however, asked for some bounty that would distinguish them from those to whom Allah gave wealth and so they gave their surplus money in charity. In response, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) directed them to certain types of charity of which they were capable. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Has Allah not given you something to give as charity?!\" \"Every utterance of \u2018Subh\u0101n Allah' is charity,\" i.e., saying \"glory be to Allah\" is recorded as a reward of charity. \"every utterance of \u2018All\u0101hu akbar' is charity,\" i.e., saying \"Allah is the Greatest.\" \"every utterance of \u2018Alhamdulill\u0101h' is charity,\" i.e., saying \"praise be to Allah.\" \"every utterance of \u2018L\u0101 il\u0101ha illa Allah' is charity,\" i.e., saying \"there is no god but Allah.\" \"commanding the right is charity;\" it is recorded for him as a reward. \"Ma\u2018roof\" (the right): It is a term that refers to all that is known to be obedience to Allah Almighty and kindness to people. \"forbidding the wrong\" is recorded as a reward of 'charity' for the one who forbids it. \"Munkar\" (the wrong): It is every reprehensible deed or word that leads to disobedience to Allah Almighty, and it is a term that refers to all kinds of evil. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) told them that if a man approaches his wife - alluding to the copulation and sexual intercourse between a man and his wife - this counts as charity. They said in wonder: \"O Messenger of Allah, does one of us satisfy his desire and get rewarded for that?!\" In response, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"What if he satisfies it unlawfully? Will he not incur a sin?\" i.e., if he commits adultery and satisfies his desire unlawfully, will he incur a sin and be subject to a penalty? Likewise, if he satisfies it lawfully, he will obtain a reward, for permissible things turn into acts of obedience by virtue of sincere intentions.\nIn a version narrated by Muslim and reported by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him): \"So, the poor among the Muh\u0101jir\u016bn (immigrants) returned to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and said: 'Our brethren, the possessors of wealth, have heard about what we did, and they have done the same.'

All this entails gratitude and praise to Allah. But how could that possibly be equal to Allah's favors?! However, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) directed us in this Had\u012bth to an act that pleases our Lord, Exalted be He. He told us that Allah Almighty created all children of Adam in one form. He informed us that people's body is created with \"three hundred and sixty joints\". The joint is the place at which two bones are joined in the body. And this is one of the things for which thanks should be given. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) directed us to some forms of worship that save those who perform them from Hellfire. He said: \"He who proclaims the greatness of Allah\", extolling Him or saying: All\u0101hu Akbar (Allah is the Greatest); \"praises Allah, declares Allah's oneness\" by saying: L\u0101 Il\u0101ha Illa Allah (there is no god but Allah); \"glorifies Allah\", declaring Him far exalted above such attributes that do not befit Him, this is to say: Subh\u0101n Allah (glory be to Allah); \"and removes\", i.e., turns away and puts aside \"a stone, a thorn, or a bone from people's path\". The word 'or' aims at diversification. The intended meaning is to remove all harmful objects with the intention to remove harm in pursuit of Allah's reward. This also applies to enjoining Ma'r\u016bf (good) and forbidding Munkar (evil). Ma\u2018r\u016bf: It is a term that comprises all that is known to be a form of obedience to Allah Almighty and benevolence to people. \"Munkar\": It is every reprehensible deed or word that leads to disobedience to Allah Almighty, and it is a term that refers to all kinds of evil.\nSo, if anyone performs these aforementioned good acts and the like to the number of three hundred and sixty joints, he will walk on earth having saved and turned himself away from the fire of the Hereafter.\nIn a Had\u012bth by Muslim, Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Sufficient instead of all that are two Rak\u2018ahs which he offers in the forenoon\", i.e., it is sufficient instead of the charities due on the joints to offer the Duha prayer, which comprises two Rak\u2018ahs. This is because prayer is an act that uses all the body parts and includes all that has been mentioned, of charities and other deeds.\nThe Had\u012bth points out that the creation of man requires praise and gratitude to Allah.\nIt indicates that there are numerous areas of goodness that lead to salvation from Hellfire.\nIt shows that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) directed his Ummah to all goodness and what involves obedience to their Lord, as well as gratitude and praise to Him, Exalted be He.\nThe Had\u012bth urges the performance of good deeds in a continued and persistent manner.."}, {"number": 347, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"The earth will vomit long pieces of its liver like columns of gold and silver, and the murderer will come and say: It was for this that I committed murder; the breaker of kinship ties will come and say: It was for this that I broke the kinship ties; and the thief will come and say: It was for this that my hands were cut off.

One of the minor signs of the Hour, which is yet to happen, is that the earth will bring out its hidden treasures.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informs us that a day will come when the earth will throw pieces of its liver. i.e., it will bring out the pieces and treasures buried in its bowels. What is inside the earth is called liver by way of likening it to the liver in the abdomen of camels and other animals. In fact, this is the dearest among the things hidden therein, just as the liver is the tastiest among the contents of the abdomen of camels and the most beloved among them to the Arabs. \"like columns of gold and silver\". He likened them to columns for their massive size and abundance. \"and the murderer will come and say: It was for this\", i.e., for the like of this and because of this, I killed the soul forbidden by Allah to be killed. The one who broke kinship ties due to his intense keenness on wealth will come, look at what the earth brought out, and say: It was for this that I broke the ties with my relatives. I did not uphold the ties with them and denied them their rights. And the thief will come and say: It is for the like of wealth that I stole and so my hands were cut off as a legal punishment. Then, after they looked and said what they said, they would leave the treasure thrown by the earth, as it would be abundant and become like dust, and they would be in no need for it and have no desire for collecting wealth or because it would be of no avail then, as the Hour would be imminent and hopes for staying in worldly life would be dashed.."}, {"number": 348, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"Indeed, Allah is good and accepts only what is good.

And He says: {O you who believe, eat of the good things We have provided for you.} [Surat al-Baqarah: 172]\" He then mentioned a person who travels for so long that his hair is disheveled, and he is covered with dust, and he lifts his hands toward the sky (saying), \"O Lord, O Lord,\" but his food is unlawful, his drink is unlawful, his clothing is unlawful, and he has been nourished by the unlawful. So, how could that be answered?!.", "commentary": "This Had\u012bth is one of the Had\u012bths that constitute the principles of Islam and the foundations of rulings. In it, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informs his Ummah about the reasons for accepting supplications and that Allah is good and exalted above imperfections and He loves what is lawful and good. He (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) tells us that Allah is 'good' and exalted above imperfections and defects, and He possesses the perfect attributes and does not accept charity or other deeds unless they are free from the Shar\u2018i defects and evil intentions. And he said that Allah commanded the believers with what He commanded His messengers, delivering to them the same speech; He commanded them to eat what is lawful and act righteously. Allah says in His Qur'an: {O messengers, eat from the lawful things and act righteously, for I am All-Knowing of what you do.} [Surat al-Mu\u2019min\u016bn: 51] This call is addressed to all prophets, yet not at the same time, for they were sent at different times; rather, each of them was addressed at his time. This indicates that the legalization of good things is old legislation and that monasticism, and the abandonment of pleasures are objectionable. It also gives an indication that eating good things is conducive to righteous deeds whereby one seeks closeness to Allah Almighty. Allah Almighty commands the believers, saying: {O you who believe, eat of the good things We have provided for you.} [Surat al-Baqarah: 172] Meaning: O you who believe, eat of His lawful and pleasant things.\nThen, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) mentioned a person who travels for so long and frequently embarks on journeys; he travels for acts of worship, such as Hajj, \u2018Umrah, Jihad, the pursuit of knowledge, and other areas of goodness. So, his hair becomes disheveled and scattered due to his long travel and fatigue, as he fails to tidy or comb his hair. Moreover, the color of his skin and clothes becomes dusty. In this state of his disheveled hair, dustiness, fatigue, and exhaustion, he raises his hands toward the sky in supplication - and raising one's hands toward the sky is one of the reasons that make a supplication readily answered - and says repeatedly: \"O Lord, O Lord.\" It indicates that supplication with the word 'Lord' influences it being answered. So, it combined four reasons for making a supplication readily answered: Long travel, dull clothes and appearance, raising the hands toward the sky, and importunately asking Allah by repeatedly mentioning His lordship.\nYet his food, drink, and clothing are obtained through unlawful earning, and he has been nourished by the unlawful. His words \"and he has been nourished by the unlawful\" after the words \"but his food is unlawful\" is either because the fact that his food is unlawful does not necessitate that he has been nourished by it, or this points out that both conditions do equally apply to him; i.e., when he spends as an adult and when he was provided for as a child. In both conditions, the unlawful reaches his abdomen. So, by his words \"but his food is unlawful,\" he pointed to his condition as an adult, and by his words \"and he has been nourished by the unlawful,\" he pointed to his condition as a child.\nSo, the unlawful money was a reason for not answering his supplication. As the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"So, how\" i.e., for what reason \"could that\" i.e., the man or because of his mentioned condition \"be answered?!\" The question here denotes unlikelihood.\nThe Had\u012bth urges us to spend money out of lawful money and prohibits otherwise.\nIt indicates that drink, food, clothing, and the like should be lawful, pure, and subject to no suspicion.\nIt also exhorts us to close the door to unlawful earning and block the means to the unlawful, by declaring it as a reason for not answering supplications.."}, {"number": 349, "hadith": "Jar\u012br reported:  We were with Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in the early morning when there came to him some people barefooted and nude, clad in striped woolen rags, or covered with cloaks, with swords hanging down from their necks. Most of them, rather all of them, belonged to the Mudar tribe. The Prophet's face changed when he saw them starving. Then, he went into his house and came out, then he commanded Bil\u0101l to call the Adh\u0101n. So, he called the Adh\u0101n and the Iq\u0101mah, and he prayed and then delivered a sermon, saying: {O people, fear your Lord Who created you from a single soul} to the rest of the verse: {for Allah is ever Watchful over you} [Surat an-Nis\u0101\u2019: 1]. And the verse in Surat al-Hashr: {O you who believe, fear Allah, and let every soul consider what it has sent forth for tomorrow. And fear Allah} [Surat al-Hashr: 18]. A man gave charity from his Dinar, from his Dirham, from his clothes, from S\u0101\u2018 of his wheat, and from S\u0101\u2018 of his dates, until he said: \"Be it half a date.\" He said: Then, a man from the Ans\u0101r came with a bundle which was difficult for him to hold in his hand. He said: Thereafter, the people came successively until I saw two heaps of food and clothes. I noticed that the Messenger's face was glowing like gilded silver. Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Whoever introduces a good practice in Islam, he will have its reward and the reward of those who act upon it after him without anything being diminished from their rewards. And whoever introduces an evil practice in Islam will shoulder its sin and the sins of those who act upon it, without diminishing in any way their sins.\" [In a version]: We were with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in the early morning... and the rest is the same. It includes- He said: Then, he performed the Zhuhr prayer and then delivered a sermon. [In a version]: I was sitting with the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) when there came to him some people who were clad in woolen rags... and they narrated the Had\u012bth and its story. And it included- He offered the Zhuhr prayer and then ascended a small pulpit. He praised Allah, extolled Him, and then said: To proceed; indeed, Allah revealed in His Book: {O people, fear your Lord} to the rest of the verse. [In a version]: Some nomad Arabs came to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), dressed in woolen clothes. He saw their dismal condition, as they were in severe want, and he narrated a similar Had\u012bth..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was a wise mentor, and he was considerate of the conditions of the people around him. He would teach them what was suitable for them in every situation. This includes urging them to give charity to the poor and needy.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Jar\u012br ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h al-Bajali (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that they were with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in the early part of the morning, \"when there came to him some people barefooted,\" a barefooted person is one who does not wear leather socks, sandals, shoes, or any footwear, 'nude' as if they were mostly naked and wearing some clothes that concealed their private parts while leaving the rest of the body uncovered, \"clad in striped woolen rags:\" torn and worn clothes. The clothes were striped, made of wool, and were black and white in color, as if taking after the color of a tiger, i.e., they were wearing torn striped clothes. He expressed that by the word 'clad' because they wrapped the clothes around their bodies, making themselves inside them, or because they tore them from the middle and entered therein. Or they were wearing 'cloaks', which is a type of clothing. All these indications point to their severe poverty. Another feature of them is that they were hanging swords around their necks. They all belonged to Mudar, a major Arab tribe. In a version: They were Bedouins, and those are the Arabs who live in the desert. When the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) saw them in that state, his face changed and signs of sadness appeared on him, given the severe poverty he observed in them. He entered his house and then went out for the Zhuhr prayer when its time came, as related in another version; so, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanded his muezzin Bil\u0101l ibn Rab\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) to call the Adh\u0101n. So, he called the Adh\u0101n for the prayer and then the Iq\u0101mah. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) led his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) in prayer. After finishing the prayer, he ascended the pulpit and delivered a sermon. In another version: \"He ascended a small pulpit and praised Allah and extolled Him. Then, he said: to proceed,\" a phrase to separate between parts of speech when the speaker wants to shift from one topic to another. The meaning: I say after the previous testimony of faith and praise of Allah Almighty. Then, he recited the verse that reads: {O people, fear your Lord Who created you from a single soul, and created from it its mate, and from both of them created countless men and women. Fear Allah in Whose name you ask one another, and be mindful of your kinship ties, for Allah is ever Watchful over you.} [Surat an-Nis\u0101\u2019: 1] This is the first verse of Surat an-Nis\u0101\u2019, wherein Allah Almighty calls out to His servants and commands them to fear Him, by observing His commands and prohibitions, for He is the One Who created them from a single soul, namely their father Adam, and created from Adam his wife Eve, their mother, and from both of them, He created so many people, males and females, all over the world. Then, He, Exalted be He, commands them again to fear Him, stressing the significance of this for the Muslim. He is the One in Whose name if one of you asks another for something, he will grant his request. Likewise, extol Him by obeying His commands to you, and beware of cutting the kinship ties that connect you together. Indeed, Allah is ever Watchful over you, and nothing of your deeds escapes Him; rather, He records them and recompenses you accordingly.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) recited to them the verse that reads: {O you who believe, fear Allah, and let every soul consider what it has sent forth for tomorrow. And fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is All-Aware of what you do.} [Surat al-Hashr: 18] Allah Almighty directs the call in this verse to the believers, and after He, Exalted be He, commands them to fear Him, He invites them to perform the righteous deeds that will preserve them in the Hereafter.\nThen, in his sermon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) advised and urged them to give charity, saying: \"A man gave charity\" is an informative statement that gives the sense of command, meaning: Let a man give charity according to his ability \"from his Dinar,\" which is gold, or \"from his Dirham,\" which is silver, or \"from his clothes,\" or \"from S\u0101\u2018 of his wheat,\" or \"from a S\u0101\u2018 of his dates.\" This falls under giving food in charity. A S\u0101\u2018 is a kind of measure that was used during the Prophet's time. Here it is not meant as a specific measure but urging them to give charity from what is possible. \"until he said: be it half a date.\"\nJar\u012br (may Allah be pleased with him) said that a man from the Ans\u0101r - the people of Mad\u012bnah - came with 'a bundle' - which is a tied sack containing Dirhams or Dinars - that was difficult for him to hold in his hand, given its heaviness due to numerous coins therein. Thereafter, the people came successively and gave charity one after another, until Jar\u012br ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) saw \"two heaps.\" A heap refers to a lot of things placed one on top of the other. \"of food and clothes;\" they were probably singled out, with no mention of money, because food and clothes were the dominant elements. This was until he noticed that the Messenger's face was glowing in joy and pleasure, like \"gilded silver,\" which is more profound in indicating the beauty and brightness of the face. The meaning: The Prophet's face became cheerful so much so that it glowed and brightened in pleasure and joy over the Muslims' readiness to obey Allah and His Messenger, give from their money, fulfill the needs of those needy people, show compassion towards their brothers, and cooperate in righteousness and piety.\nThen, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Whoever introduces a good practice in Islam,\" i.e., he introduces a praiseworthy way that is confirmed by one of the fundamental principles of the religion, or which becomes a motive and reason for promoting something established in the Shariah; and others follow his example in it. So, he will obtain the reward for doing this act, as well as the reward of those who do it after he has introduced this practice, without anything, large or small, being diminished from their rewards. Indeed, this reward is for prompting them to do this act, not for the act itself. This points to the Prophet's praise of the Ans\u0101ri man who came with the bundle, shows his merit, and encourages his act. \"And whoever introduces an evil practice in Islam,\" i.e., he does a reprehensible act and produces an unpraiseworthy way that is not supported by any of the fundamental principles of the religion, and he begins to engage in it before others, and so others follow his example in this regard; hence, he will incur the sin for doing it and the sin of those who do it after him, without anything being diminished from their sins.\nThe Had\u012bth urges that a person hasten to do good first, so that others can follow his example. It also warns that he shouldn't be the first to do evil, lest his example be followed by others.\nIt encourages the doing of good whose reward is repeated by virtue of imitation and warns against evil whose sin is repeated because of imitation.\nIt shows the Prophet's mercy towards his Ummah.."}, {"number": 350, "hadith": "\u2018Umayr, the freed slave of \u0100bi al-Lahm, reported:  My master commanded me to cut some meat into strips. Meanwhile, a poor man came to me, and I gave him some of it to eat. My master came to know about it, and he beat me. I went to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and mentioned that to him. So, he summoned him and said: \"Why did you beat him?\" He said: \"He gives away my food without me commanding him to do so.\" He said: \"The reward is divided between you.\".", "commentary": "Islam is the religion of virtuous morals and sublime manners with all people, even servants who serve others in return for wages and slaves and bondmen; Islam enjoined kindness to them and helped liberate them from slavery and servitude.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Umayr, the freed slave of \u0100bi al-Lahm (may Allah be pleased with him), relates that that his owner and master commanded him to cut some meat and dry it in the sun, a common practice among the Arabs. Qadd: is a lengthwise cutting. Some versions contain: \"to Aqdur meat\" i.e., to cook a pot of meat.\nMeanwhile, a poor, needy person came to him, and he gave him a part of the meat without permission from his master. When his master learned about what he spent and gave in charity, he beat him as a discipline for his wrong act of disposing of someone else's property without their permission. \u2018Umayr (may Allah be pleased with him) came to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and related to him what happened. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) sent for his owner to come to him. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked him: \"Why did you beat him?\" By this, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) first sought clarification about the beating and its cause. The man, the owner of the money and the slave's master, cited the reason that he gave out from his food without his permission. So, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: \"The reward is divided between you,\" i.e., do not beat him for that, because the reward obtained for the charity he gave from your property is divided between the two of you if you agree to that and make it permissible for your servant to give such things that are usually tolerated; so, you will have the reward for charity. This is not intended as approval that a slave may give from his master's property without his permission. Rather, he disliked the master's attitude as he beat him for something that turned out to be good. So, he urged the master to seize the reward and pardon him. This constitutes teaching and guidance for \u0100bi al-Lahm, not approval of the slave's action.\nHis statement: \"The reward is divided between you\" does not mean that the reward of one of them is shared with the other; thus the reward of the money itself is divided between the two of them. Rather, it means that each of them has a reward. In other words, this charity which the slave gives out with the permission of his master entails a reward for the amount of money and for the deed. Thus, it is divided between them: this person takes the share of his money, and this person takes the share of his deed. So, the owner of the money does not compete with the performer of the deed over the share of his deed, neither does the performer of the deed compete with the owner of the money over the share of his money.\nThe Had\u012bth mentions that the slave and the master are rewarded for the charity given by the slave: the master is rewarded for his money, and the slave is rewarded for his deed.\nIt indicates that a master can discipline his slave if he acts wrongly.."}, {"number": 351, "hadith": "\u2018Umayr, the freed slave of \u0100bi al-Lahm, reported:  I was a slave, and I asked the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): \"May I give charity from the money of my masters?\" He said: \"Yes, and the reward will be half and half between you.\".", "commentary": "Islam urges noble manners and forbids evil ones. Noble manners include spending and giving charity to the poor and upholding kinship ties.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Umayr, the freed slave of \u0100bi al-Lahm, relates that he was a slave at the early stage of Islam, and as he was a slave, not possessing money and could not dispose of his master's money. So, he asked the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) about giving charity from his master's money to the poor and needy. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) replied to him: \"Yes, and the reward will be half and half between you\" i.e., yes, you have the right to give charity from the money of your masters, and the reward of charity will be divided between you. So, Allah will give the reward to the servant who gives charity for his deed and will give the reward to the owner of the money for his money.\nWhat appears from the narrations of this Had\u012bth is that the reward is divided between both of you if the master agrees to that and permits his servant to give charity out of his money in the first place. It is not intended that the slave may give without the approval of his master.\nThe reward being divided between them does not mean that the reward of one of them is shared with the other; thus the reward of the money itself is divided between the two of them. Rather, it means that each of them has a reward. In other words, this charity that the slave gives out with the permission of his master entails a reward for the amount of money and for the deed. Thus, it is divided between them: this person takes the share of his money, and this person takes the share of his deed. So, the owner of the money does not compete with the performer of the deed over the share of his deed, neither does the performer of the deed compete with the owner of the money over the share of his money.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that we should ask the people of knowledge about things that cause unease within our minds.\nIt also points out that people should take care of their slaves and servants and comfort them by allowing them to give charity from their money, with their permission.\nAnd it mentions that the slave and the master are rewarded for the charity given by the slave: the master is rewarded for his money, and the slave is rewarded for his deed.."}, {"number": 352, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"Who amongst you is fasting today?\" Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"I am.\" He said: \"Who amongst you followed a funeral procession today?\" Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"I did.\" He said: \"Who amongst you fed a needy person today? Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"I did.\" He said: \"Who amongst you visited a sick person today? Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"I did.\" Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"They are not combined in a man except that he will enter Paradise.\".", "commentary": "One of the features of Prophetic guidance and education was that he used to draw people's minds and attention to his subject by asking a question. In this way, those present would become attentive. This is because every question by him (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had a certain significance and objective, which would be known after the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) clarified and revealed the purpose behind his question.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) directs us to some virtues that lead those in whom they are combined to enter Paradise. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked a question to his Companions who were in his gathering. \"Who amongst you is fasting today? Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"I am.\" He answered by saying \"I am\" by way of giving specific information, not as a form of self-pride, as people say when they are boastful. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) followed this question with other questions to proceed with clarifying the causes of entering Paradise. He said: \"Who amongst you followed a funeral procession today?\" by offering the funeral prayer and following the funeral procession till the deceased person is buried. Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) replied: \"I did.\" So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked: \"Who amongst you fed a needy person today? And he made him satiated and gave him the food he needed. A needy person is the one who cannot find sufficient sustenance. Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) replied: \"I did.\" So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked: \"Who amongst you visited a sick person today?\" Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) replied: \"I did.\" So, regarding all the traits and acts the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked about, Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) replied that he did all of them. Thus, all these honorable deeds were combined in one day for Abu Bakr as-Sidd\u012bq (may Allah be pleased with him). This indicates the keenness of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) to do all kinds of virtuous deeds, seek their areas, and seize their times, as if he had nothing but pursuing them and seeking to get their rewards.\nSo, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said that if these four acts are combined and done in one day by someone, he will enter Paradise. It probably means that he will enter Paradise without reckoning or recompense for his bad deeds; otherwise, the mere Im\u0101n (faith) is sufficient for entering Paradise, even if the sinner is punished in Hellfire for his sins; his ultimate outcome is entering Paradise, so long as he is a believer in Tawh\u012bd (monotheism); or it means: He will enter Paradise from any gate he wills, and Allah knows best.\nThe Had\u012bth shows the merit of righteous deeds, including fasting, charity, feeding the needy, and visiting the sick, and that they are traits and acts that lead to entering Paradise.\nIt points out that Abu Bakr as-Sidd\u012bq (may Allah be pleased with him) possessed virtues, and this is part of his noble characteristics (may Allah be pleased with him).\nIt demonstrates how the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to check on his Companions and direct them to do various kinds of good deeds.."}, {"number": 353, "hadith": "Abu \u2019Um\u0101mah reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"O son of Adam, indeed if you spend your surplus wealth, it is good for you; and if you withhold it, it is bad for you. You are not blameworthy regarding the subsistence. Begin with your dependents. And the upper hand is better than the lower hand.\".", "commentary": "This Had\u012bth contains a Prophetic instruction to people not to withhold and amass wealth, and it directs them to spend and give and not to beg of others. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) says: \"O son of Adam\"; this is a call from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to all children of Adam, though his instruction is particularly addressed to his Muslim Ummah. To spend your excessive wealth and give it in charity for the sake of Allah is \"good for you\" in this world and the Hereafter for its enduring reward. But to withhold this surplus and deny it to others is \"bad for you\" in the sight of Allah and the sight of people because if someone withholds it from fulfilling a duty, he deserves the punishment for that. If he withholds it from doing something commendable, this diminishes his reward, and he misses a benefit for himself in the Hereafter, and this is all bad.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) determines that a person is not to blame for withholding the money sufficient for him and his dependents and which enables him to spend on his family, lest they may beg people. Subsistence is the provision that suffices a person and makes him in no need for begging others, along with contentment, and it does not exceed one's needs.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) instructs us to begin with our dependents, such as ourselves and our wives and children. Indeed, the best charity is what a person gives out of his wealth after fulfilling the rights of himself and his dependents so that the giver of charity will not become needy after giving charity to others. His statement \"begin with your dependents\" is evidence that spending on one's family is better than giving charity, for charity is voluntary, whereas spending on one's family is obligatory. This all falls under the Prophetic education to be abstinent and content, prioritize spending to provide for his family and dependents sufficiently and give charity when financially stable.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) determines an instructive rule, saying: \"And the upper hand\", which spends, \"is better than the lower hand\" i.e., which begs or takes.\nThe Had\u012bth directs us to spend our excessive money on charitable and good purposes.\nIt determines the order of priority in spending, giving, and charity, and we should begin with what is more important and then what is next in importance.."}, {"number": 354, "hadith": "Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say:  \"Whoever Allah wills to do good to, He makes him well-versed in the religion.\" And I heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say: \"Indeed, I am a treasurer, so whoever I give something willingly will be blessed for him, and whoever I give something due to his begging and covetousness is like one who eats and is not satiated.\".", "commentary": "Allah Almighty is Forbearing and Merciful toward His servants, and He loves good for them. And our Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was the best-natured person among people, and he taught us abstinence and contentment.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informs that when Allah wants to do a lot of good and a great benefit to someone, He makes him well-versed in religion. He grants him the Shar\u2018i knowledge and awareness of the matters of his religion until he gains a proper understanding of it and becomes knowledgeable about the truth, acting upon it and calling others to it with insight and guidance. This is the goodness to which no other goodness in this existence comes close in terms of its merit, honor, and high status, for it is the legacy of the prophets, who left behind no other legacy.\nGoodness is particularly linked to having a good understanding of the religion and not merely hearing and bearing the Fiqh, for the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), in a Had\u012bth narrated by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd and others, said: \"May Allah brighten (his face) a man who hears a Had\u012bth from us, memorizes it, and passes it on to others, for a bearer of Fiqh may convey it to someone who has better understanding than him, and there may be a bearer of Fiqh who is not a Faq\u012bh.\" A person who hears a Had\u012bth and narrates it may not be a scholar or Faq\u012bh, but he memorizes the Sunnah and passes it on to others who are capable of comprehension and deduction. A Faq\u012bh in religion is one who can deal with the texts and understand them properly, and thus, things become clear to him, and he can see the way. This type of knowledge leads the one who possesses it to fear Allah, adhere to His obedience, and avoid His prohibitions. Fiqh in religion is attained by contemplating the texts of the Qur\u2019an and the Sunnah and knowing the treasures, creeds, rulings, and wisdom contained therein.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Indeed, I am a treasurer\", i.e., a trustee and preserver of what Allah Almighty gave me. The real Giver is Allah Almighty, not me. I only distribute what I have in the way Allah commanded me. Verily, all matters happen according to His will and determination, Exalted be He, whereas people are directed slaves of Allah. \"So, whoever I give something\" without him asking for it; rather, I give it to him \"willingly, it will be blessed for him,\" i.e., the benefits of this taken money will increase, and it will see greater growth. \"and whoever I give something due to his begging and covetousness\", i.e., as for a person who asks for something while coveting it and being keen to obtain it, he is \"like one who eats and is not satiated\", i.e., the more he takes from it, the greater his desire for it becomes, and he becomes covetous, belittles what he possesses, and aspires to have more. As a result, Allah Almighty does not bless what he has taken by begging, while the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) disliked his importunateness. This demonstrates the evil outcome of begging without a valid excuse.\nThe Had\u012bth points out the merit of knowledge and acquiring knowledge of the religion.\nIt urges abstinence and contentment and forbids begging without necessity.."}, {"number": 355, "hadith": "Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah ibn Abi Sufy\u0101n (may Allah be pleased with him) said:  \"Beware of Had\u012bths, except those Had\u012bths during the reign of \u2018Umar, for indeed \u2018Umar used to make people fearful of Allah Almighty.\".", "commentary": "Transmitting the Prophet's Sunnah and narrating Had\u012bths from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) is a great matter and serious responsibility. The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) were keen on the accuracy and authenticity of these narrations.\nIn this tradition, Caliph Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah ibn Abi Sufy\u0101n (may Allah be pleased with him) warns his subjects and those around him about the excessive narrating of Had\u012bths from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) without verification of the reports or differentiation between the Sunnah and Prophetic Had\u012bths and other reports, lest they might engage in lying about the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Indeed, lying about the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) is a sin that is more grave than lying about others. Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah's warning to the people was during his reign, given the prevalent transmission of reports about the People of the Book and the contents that were found in their books after their countries were conquered. So, he feared that their statements could be mixed with the statements of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Yet, he excluded the time and reign of 'Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b (may Allah be pleased with him), saying: \"Beware of Had\u012bths, except those Had\u012bths during the reign of \u2018Umar\" i.e., unless you accept and narrate the Had\u012bths that were known, widely acted upon, and acknowledged during the time of \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). And more worthy among them are those Had\u012bths that were narrated by \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) himself.\nThen, clarifying why he excluded Had\u012bths that were during the reign of \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), he said: \"For indeed 'Umar used to make people fearful\" by his strength and firmness, as he used to punish those who committed mistakes and beat them with his small staff in order to defend and preserve the rights of Allah Almighty and the matters of His religion, lest the Had\u012bths of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) might be subject to distortion and alteration. Therefore, Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) urged the people to refer to the Had\u012bths that were narrated during that era, given that it was marked by great meticulousness in the narration of Had\u012bths. This is because 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) used to emphasize to his subjects the seriousness of transmitting reports from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). For example, he would require witnesses for Had\u012bths. So, he regulated this matter, and the people feared his authority and prohibition of hurried narration of Had\u012bths. As a result, the sound Had\u012bths were verified, and the Sunan became widely known and distinguished from other texts during his time (may Allah be pleased with him).\nThis does not limit the meticulousness in the narration of Had\u012bths to the reign of 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) only, but it also existed during the Prophet's lifetime and after that, till the era of Had\u012bth compilation, as Allah Almighty caused to exist those who revised the Had\u012bths of His Messenger (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and distinguished the sound ones from others and verified the narrations and those who transmitted them, based on precise and strict rules. Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah's attitude shows his keenness during his time in examining and distinguishing the Prophet's statements from others.\nThe Had\u012bth points out the merit of \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b (may Allah be pleased with him) with regard to preserving the Sunnah during his caliphate.\nThe ruler should urge his subjects to seek knowledge and try to verify and distinguish the sound from the unsound.."}, {"number": 356, "hadith": "Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"Do not be importunate in asking, for by Allah, if one of you asks me for something and I give it to him while I am reluctant, there will be no blessing in what I give him.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was keen to teach and educate the Muslims to be well-mannered and to ask for things with dignity in all matters. This is intended to keep the relationships between the Muslims good and free from such ill feelings as hatred, anger, and the like, which may exist due to importunate and persistent asking.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) directs us not to ask for something in an immoderate or importunate manner, needlessly and unjustifiably. Allah Almighty says: {They do not ask people importunately.} [Surat al-Baqarah: 273] Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) explained why he forbade importunate asking. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) swore in an emphatic way that if anyone importunately asks him for something and he grants his request, while the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) is actually reluctant to give that thing to him, because he only gives it to him to avert his bad attitude, the result is that Allah Almighty will not bless him in what he has taken by persistent and importunate asking. This demonstrates the evil outcome of importunate asking.\nThe Had\u012bths reported from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) indicate that blessing will exist in the given money if it is given willingly and taken kindly.\nIt urges abstinence and kindness and prohibits asking for something without necessity.."}, {"number": 357, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"He who asks people for their wealth to increase his own only asks for live coals; so, let him ask for a little or much.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was keen to teach the Muslims and educate them to be well-mannered and to ask for anything in a good and dignified way.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) says that if a person asks people to give him from their wealth to increase his own wealth without truly being in need, the result of such asking is that this money will become live coals in the Hereafter with which he will be burned. This is also indicated by another version in Sunan Ibn M\u0101jah: \"he only asks for the live coals of Hell.\" Seeking to increase one's wealth is called live coals because live coals come because of it. This is similar to the verse that reads: {Indeed, those who consume the orphans\u2019 property unjustly, only consume fire into their bellies} to the rest of the verse. [Surat an-Nis\u0101\u2019: 10]\nAfter this intimidation and clarification, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"so, let him ask for a little or much,\" i.e., let the beggar take a little of these live coals, or let him take much of it. This command was said by way of threatening, warning, and deriding.\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) left it to the beggar whether he wants to ask for a little or much, seeking to deter him from that. Begging is self-humiliating, and Allah Almighty does not like it for the believer. A Muslim should be self-respecting.\nThe Had\u012bth warns against devouring people's property unjustly.\nIt shows disapproval of begging people without necessity.\nIt also demonstrates the penalty for he who begs of people often.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that the Day of Judgment is the day of full recompense, be it a reward or punishment.."}, {"number": 358, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say:  \"For one of you to go out early to gather firewood and carry it on his back so that he can give charity from it and be free of the need to people is better for him than asking a man who may give to him or refuse. Indeed, the upper hand is more virtuous than the lower hand, and begin with your dependents.\" [In a version]: \"By Allah, for one of you to go out early in the morning to gather firewood and carry it on his back and sell it for its equivalent.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was keen on teaching and educating Muslims to be well-mannered and to ask for things with dignity in all matters. This is intended to keep the relationships between the Muslims good and free from ill feelings such as hatred, anger, and the like, which may exist due to importunate and persistent asking.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) teaches us that if a poor man goes out in the early morning and gathers firewood and carries it on his back and then sells it and earns money, and from this money he gives charity and becomes in no need for begging from people - even though this involves hardship - is better, nobler and more honorable and merciful for him \"than to ask a man\" and beg from others. \"Who may give to him or refuse?\" Giving and withholding are alike; both are humiliating. If he refuses to give to him, he makes him heartbroken and sad; and if he gives to him, this counts as a favor bestowed upon him.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) urged abstinence, saying: \"the upper hand\", which gives, is more virtuous and dearer in the sight of Allah Almighty \"than the lower hand\", which begs and takes charity.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) instructs us to begin with our dependents, including ourselves and our wives and children. Indeed, the best charity is what a person gives out of his wealth after fulfilling the rights of himself and his dependents so that the giver of charity does not become in need after giving charity to others. His statement \"begin with your dependents\" shows that spending on one's family is better than giving charity, for charity is voluntary, whereas spending on one's family is obligatory. This all falls under the Prophetic education to be abstinent and content and prioritize spending so that a person should sufficiently provide for his family and dependents and then give charity when   financially stable.\nThe Had\u012bth urges us to eat from the earnings of our labor and to earn money by permitted means, like collecting firewood, and it urges us to give charity.."}, {"number": 359, "hadith": "\u2018Awf ibn M\u0101lik al-Ashja\u2018i reported:  We were with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and we were nine, eight, or seven. He said: \"Will you not give the pledge of allegiance to the Messenger of Allah?\" We said: \"We have already given you the pledge of allegiance, O Messenger of Allah.\" Then, he said: \"Will you not give the pledge of allegiance to the Messenger of Allah?\" We said: \"We have already given you the pledge of allegiance, O Messenger of Allah.\" Then, he said: \"Will you not give the pledge of allegiance to the Messenger of Allah?\" He said: We extended our hands and said: \"We have already given you the pledge of allegiance, O Messenger of Allah. So, for what should we give you the pledge of allegiance?\" He said: \"To worship Allah and not associate any partners with him; to establish the five prayers; to obey; (and he said in a low tone) and to not ask people for anything. Indeed, I saw some of those men so much so that if the whip fell from one of them, he would not ask anyone to hand it to him.\".", "commentary": "Mub\u0101ya\u2018ah is to give the pledge of allegiance to adhere to Islam and be committed to abide by its rulings. It was called Mub\u0101ya\u2018ah because each one of those involved in it would extend his hand to his companion, and as it involves the Mu\u2018\u0101wadah (compensation), as Allah Almighty says: {Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their wealth, and in return they will have Paradise.} [Surat at-Tawbah: 111] This was a deal with Allah Almighty.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Awf ibn M\u0101lik al-Ashja\u2018i (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that he was with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) within a group of the Companions, who had recently given the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). They numbered nine, eight, or seven. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked them to give him the pledge of allegiance, beginning his speech with words that drew their attention and aroused their minds, saying: \"Will you not give the pledge of allegiance to the Messenger of Allah?\" This is intended to urge them to give the pledge of allegiance to him (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). He said, \"give the pledge of allegiance to the Messenger of Allah,\" and did not say, \"give the pledge of allegiance to me,\" to notify that the motive for this pledge is the message. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) repeated his question \"Will you not give the pledge of allegiance to the Messenger of Allah?\" three times to exert emphasis on that. So, they extended their hands after the third time to give the pledge of allegiance, in compliance with the Prophet's command. When they wanted to give the pledge of allegiance to him (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), they said: \"We have already given you the pledge of allegiance, O Messenger of Allah.\" They said that thinking he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) may have forgotten that they had previously given him the pledge of allegiance, as they had done so only recently. Hence, they wanted to remind him of that. Or they sought clarification over what kind of pledge of allegiance was required of them now? This is indicated by their words \"for what?\" i.e., what are the things over which we should \"give you the pledge of allegiance?\" In response, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"To worship Allah\" alone, to obey Him, and not to associate any partners with him, major or minor Shirk and the apparent or hidden one. The second thing is to give the pledge of allegiance over establishing the obligatory \"five prayers\" along with their requirements and pillars. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said \"in a low tone,\" i.e., he did not say these words as loudly as he said the previous ones. These words are about not asking people for anything. Thus, he urged self-restraint and presenting one's needs to Allah alone and not asking any person for anything. It seems that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) uttered the prohibition about asking people in a low voice so as to direct this to some people and not others and not to make it applicable to everyone, for this cannot be applicable to all, because asking is unavoidable, self-restraint is necessary, richness is sure to exist, and poverty is certainly there. Allah Almighty predestined all of these. So, people are necessarily divided into two categories.\nThe prohibited asking is that which pertains to worldly matters. This does not include asking about knowledge and religious matters, as Allah Almighty says: {Ask the people of knowledge, if you do not know.} [Surat an-Nahl: 43]\nThis is all spiritual education and psychological discipline for the Muslims that they should ask of their Lord alone, which achieves self-restraint for themselves. By this, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) exhorts noble manners and avoidance of bearing favors from others, and he teaches patience over unpleasant things, not asking people for things, and self-respect.\nThen, \u2018Awf (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"Indeed, I saw some of those men\", referring to the Companions who gave the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in that gathering, \"that when the whip fell from one of them, he would not ask anyone to hand it to him,\" i.e., some of them took the prohibition to mean asking in general. So, if anything fell from them, they would not ask anyone to hand it over to them. Even if something fell from one of them while riding a mount, he would get off and pick it up and not ask anyone to hand it to him, in compliance with the pledge of allegiance he gave to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). This shows their care and complete observance of the things over which they gave the pledge of allegiance, even regarding such simple matters.\nThe Had\u012bth turns people away from asking others and urges them to keep away from all such things that are called asking, even if a little.\nIt also points to the adoption of general rules, for they were prohibited from asking, and so they took the prohibition to be generally applicable.."}, {"number": 360, "hadith": "Qab\u012bsah ibn Mukh\u0101riq al-Hil\u0101li reported: I became a guarantor for a payment, and I came to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to beg him regarding it. He said: \"Wait until the Zakah comes to us, and we will order it to be given to you. He said: Then, he said:  \"O Qab\u012bsah, begging is only lawful for one of three: a man who has become a guarantor for a payment; begging is lawful for him until he gets it, after which he must stop (begging); a man who has been stricken by a catastrophe and it destroys his property; begging is lawful for him until he gets what makes ends meet - or he said: what provides a sufficient subsistence; and a man who has been smitten by poverty, about whom three wise members of his people confirm by saying: So and so has been smitten by poverty; begging is lawful for him until he gets what fulfills basic needs - or he said: what provides a sufficient subsistence - after which he must stop (begging). Any other reason for begging - O Qab\u012bsah - brings unlawful gains, and one who engages in it consumes it as an unlawful gain.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was keen to teach and educate the Muslims to be well-mannered and to ask for things in a good and self-respecting way, regarding all matters. This is intended to keep the relationship among the Muslims a good one that does not involve hatred or the like.\nThis Had\u012bth clearly shows a practical aspect of this Prophetic education, and it has an illustrative introduction that demonstrates the reason that obliged and forced the Companion Qab\u012bsah ibn Mukh\u0101riq (may Allah be pleased with him) to ask for help from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Qab\u012bsah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"I became a guarantor for a payment,\" i.e., I became responsible for a debt. Payment here refers to what a person bears, takes as a debt, and pays it for the purpose of reconciliation, like reconciling between two tribes, and so on. If a guarantor asks someone to help him with the required payment, this is not regarded as detracting from his status; rather, it is considered to be a source of honor and pride. Therefore, this man asked the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to help him with this payment of his, according to their tradition. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) responded to him positively, by way of helping in what is good. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked him to wait until the Zakah of people came to him, and then the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would give him therefrom, for indeed begging was lawful for him and he deserved to be given out of the Zakah. This is because he incurred a debt for something not sinful, and he was one of those in debt who are mentioned in the verse of Zakah.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) clarified to him the types of persons for whom it is lawful to beg of people; As for the first type: It is he who incurred a debt for the purpose of reconciliation among people. He asks people for money so that he can pay off that debt. So, he takes the amount that is needed from the Zakah money, after which he should desist and refrain from asking and begging.\nThe second type of people for whom begging is lawful: \"a man who has been stricken by a catastrophe;\" a catastrophe is a blight that befalls fruits and property and eliminates them. So, if a person is hit by a heavenly blight and it eliminates his fruits or property, it becomes lawful for him to beg until he gets what fulfills his basic needs and subsistence. \"Qiw\u0101m\" and \"Sid\u0101d\" refer to such things that bring self-sufficiency and fulfill needs.\nThe third type of people for whom begging is lawful: A man who has been stricken by severe poverty, and it becomes so clear and apparent that three wise and rational persons from his people give testimony and say: \"So and so has been smitten by poverty.\" He restricted that to rational people to point out that mindfulness is required for testimony. Hence, testimony should not be accepted from simple-minded people. And he determined they should be from his people because they are more aware of his condition.\nThose are the people for whom begging is lawful, as related in the Had\u012bth. Begging for other reasons brings unlawful gains, and he who engages in it consumes unlawful gains. Indeed, unlawful gains eliminate blessing. Consuming here means benefiting in general.\nHis statement \"and one who engages in it consumes it as an unlawful gain\" signifies that a person who consumes an unlawful gain does not find a doubt that renders it permissible for himself; rather, he consumes it as an unlawful gain and a forbidden thing.\nThe Had\u012bth prohibits begging from people except for an urgent necessity.\nIt demonstrates the types of people for whom begging is lawful and clarifies the compelling reasons for that.\nIt also indicates that whoever takes people's property unjustly indeed consumes an unlawful gain and forbidden thing.."}, {"number": 361, "hadith": "Abu al-Aswad reported:  Abu M\u016bsa al-Ash'ari sent for the reciters of the people of Basra. Three hundred men who had recited the Qur'an came to him. He said: \"You are the best among the people of Basra and their reciters. So, recite it. And let not hope of a long life delude you, and thus your hearts would harden as the hearts of those before you had hardened. We used to recite a Surah, which we would liken to Bar\u0101\u2018ah in terms of length and toughness, and I was made to forget it. However, I memorized from it: \"If the son of Adam had two valleys of wealth, he would seek a third valley, and nothing would fill the inside of the son of Adam except dust\". We used to recite a Surah, which we would liken to one of the Musabbih\u0101t, and I was made to forget it. However, I memorized from it: \"O you who believe, why do you say what you do not do?\" This will be written as a testimony on your necks, and you will be asked about it on the Day of Judgment..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to direct his Companions and advise them to refrain from keenness on worldly life and hope for an extended stay in it. And the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) did the same with the T\u0101bi'is.\nIn this tradition, Abu al-Aswad ad-D\u012bli informs that Abu M\u016bsa al-Ash\u2018ari (may Allah be pleased with him) sent for the reciters among the people of Basra to come to him and gather there. Basra is a city located in the south of Iraq. \"Three hundred men, who had recited the Qur'an\" and memorized it \"came to him.\" He advised and directed them, saying: You are the best among the people of Basra and you are the people of the Qur\u2019an among them. Then, he instructed them to read the Qur\u2019an and recite it in the most proper manner, which entails understanding its meanings, reflecting upon its verses, and acting upon its rulings. And he said to them: \"And let not hope of a long life delude you and thus your hearts would harden,\" i.e., do not have high hopes for worldly life and do not wish to stay therein for long, as this corrupts the hearts by dragging them to greed and hardness, and thus they will not soften to Dhikr or derive benefit from admonition or rebuke. As a result, you will have such hardness and aversion within your hearts that had befallen the nations before you due to their hopes for an extended stay in the life of this world. This includes a reference to the verse that reads: {Has the time not yet come for those who believe that their hearts should be humbled at the remembrance of Allah and the truth that has been revealed? They should not be like those who were given the Scriptures before, whose hearts grew hard after the passage after a long period of time, and many of them were evildoers.} [Surat al-Had\u012bd: 16]\nThen, he informed that they used to recite a long Surah of the Qur\u2019an, whose recitation was abrogated, and they would liken it to Surat Bar\u0101\u2019ah, which is Surat at-Tawbah, in terms of length and toughness. He further said that he was made to forget it. Then, Abu M\u016bsa (may Allah be pleased with him) made an exception and informed that he memorized from the meanings of this Surah such words that contain dispraise of attention on worldly life and the love and desire for having a lot of it. He said: \"If the son of Adam had two valleys of wealth, he would seek a third valley.\" A valley is any gap between mountains or hills. \"and nothing would fill the inside of the son of Adam except dust\", i.e., he continues to be keen on worldly life till he dies, and his inside gets filled with the dust of his grave. The inside may also be intended to refer to the heart, and the meaning is that he does not get bored of the love for wealth. This is because man is naturally inclined to love wealth and has an unquenchable greed for it, and he has no limit to stop except a matter like his own, namely dust.\nThen, Abu M\u016bsa (may Allah be pleased with him) informed that they used to recite a Surah which they would liken to one of the Musabbih\u0101t, which are the Surahs that begin with \"subh\u0101n, sabbaha, yusabbihu, sabbih ism rabbika\" (glory be to, glorified, glorifies, glorify the name of your Lord), and that he was made to forget it; and he memorized from it: \"O you who believe, why do you say what you do not do?\" This is a question that signifies disapproval and rebuke for those who attribute to themselves good things that they do not do, either in relation to the past, in which case they would be liars, or concerning the future, and this would be a contradiction; both are dispraised. \"This will be written as a testimony on your necks and you will be asked about this on the Day of Judgment\" i.e., these false statements will be recorded against you, for what you said and did not do is a testimony from you, and you are liable for it, and you will be held accountable, and it will entail an evil recompense on the Day of Judgment.\nThis abrogation, which Abu M\u016bsa (may Allah be pleased with him) told about in this Had\u012bth, is one of the abrogation types: the abrogation of words and recitation. Abrogation is of three types: First: Abrogation of rulings, while words and recitation endure. Second: Its opposite; and that is the abrogation of words and recitation, while the ruling endures. Third: Abrogation of the ruling along with the words and recitation. This is the abrogation which Allah Almighty mentions in the verse that reads: {We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten.} [Surat al-Baqarah: 106] And also in the verses that read: {We will teach you [the Qur\u2019an], so you will not forget*, except what Allah wills.} [Surat al-A\u2018la: 6-7] These two Surahs are among the Surahs Allah Almighty willed to be forgotten after He revealed them. This is because Allah Almighty does whatever He wills and is Able to do all things He wishes. Indeed, this is all possible. Let not one wrongly assume, because of this and the like of it, that any part of the Qur\u2019an was lost. In fact, this is untrue, as established by the verse that reads: {It is We Who have sent down the Reminder, and it is We Who will preserve it.} [Surat al-Hijr: 9] This is also established by the consensus among the Companions and those after them that the Qur\u2019an, which we are required to recite and act upon its rulings as a form of worship, is the text contained between the two covers of the Mus'haf, without addition or omission.\nThe Had\u012bth shows keenness to present advice to the Muslim reciters.\nIt contains dispraise of the keenness on worldly life and the hope for a long stay therein.\nIt includes dispraise of lying and bragging about something one did not do.\nThe Had\u012bth also mentions that a person's speech is recorded and he will be asked about it on the Day of Judgment.\nAnd it indicates that a believer should be chiefly concerned about working for the Hereafter and he should not be deceived by worldly life and its desires.."}, {"number": 362, "hadith": "\u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Amr ibn al-\u2018\u0100s reported that: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"Successful is the one who accepts Islam and is provided with mere subsistence and Allah makes him content with what He has given him.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to admonish his Companions, advise them, and encourage them to aim at sublime matters, so that the worldly life would be in their hands, not in their hearts, and what they gained thereof would help them in acts of worship.\nThis Had\u012bth contains guidance from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to his Ummah that a person should not tire himself in seeking more than mere subsistence, for what is commendable in sustenance is the amount that enables a person to perform worship and for which he should work as much as needed. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informed that success is attained and gained by a person who embraces Islam rightly, for he gets rid of Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk (polytheism), which is the sin that Allah does not forgive, and he is provided with mere subsistence, no more or less, and what makes him self-sufficient and saves him from necessities and wants. This means lawful sustenance, for no success comes with unlawful sustenance. And his words: \"and Allah makes him content with what He has given him,\" i.e., Allah grants him contentment with the mere subsistence he has; so, he does not aspire to pursue more than that.\nThe Had\u012bth shows that success and triumph are attained by embracing Islam for the sake of Allah and being pleased with what Allah gives him.\nIt demonstrates the merit of contentment, and that it is one of the means of success.."}, {"number": 363, "hadith": "\u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b (may Allah be pleased with him) reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) distributed some wealth, and I said: \"By Allah, O Messenger of Allah, there are other than those more deserving of it than them?\" He said: \"They gave me the choice that they either ask of me importunately or regard me as a miser, and I am not a miser.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was the most generous and bountiful among the people. He would give like one who fears no poverty. This was to teach his Ummah and serve certain Shar\u2018i purposes that were probably not known or grasped at the time by anyone other than him (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b (may Allah be pleased with him) says The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) distributed some wealth among the people, and he gave some people, whereas \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b (may Allah be pleased with him) held that others were more deserving of being given than them. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) clarified to him why he gave to them and not those who were more deserving to be given than them. This is because those he gave were people of ignorance and lying. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said that they begged in an importunate manner due to their weak faith and drove him, by their very importunate attitude, to either give them what they asked for or they would describe him as a miser and defame him, while in fact, he is not a miser. Hence, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) gave to them and protected his honor by his giving, lest they might lie about him. Miserliness is not part of his character (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and he gave to them to appease them and win their friendliness. Similarly, he said in a Had\u012bth of the Two Sah\u012bh Collections: \"Indeed, the worst people in rank in the sight of Allah is the one whom people leave or abandon for fear of his discourteousness.\" Thus, he endured their rudeness and treated them forbearingly to win their friendliness and protect himself from being described as a miser, a trait that does not befit him (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that we can appease the people of ignorance and harshness and win their friendliness, if this achieves a good interest.\nIt also shows that patience and forbearance were part of the Prophet's character.\nThe Had\u012bth demonstrates and directs a person to spend out of his money to protect his honor and himself from the people of ignorance.."}, {"number": 364, "hadith": "R\u0101fi\u2018 ibn Khad\u012bj reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) gave to Abu Sufy\u0101n ibn Harb, Safw\u0101n ibn Umayyah, \u2018Uyaynah ibn Hisn, and Al-Aqra\u2018 ibn H\u0101bis, to every one of them, one hundred camels, and gave to \u2018Abb\u0101s ibn Mird\u0101s less than that.

And he narrated the same Had\u012bth, with the addition: And he gave \u2018Alqamah ibn \u2018Ul\u0101thah one hundred. [And in a version]: He did not mention poetry..", "commentary": "This Had\u012bth reveals a part of how the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to win people's hearts to Islam by giving them money, each according to the strength of \u012am\u0101n in his heart or his tenderness, and how he was considerate of the circumstances of each one of them.\nThe circumstances surrounding this Had\u012bth: After the battle of Hunayn, which took place in the eighth Hijri year between the Muslims and the two tribes of Haw\u0101zin and Thaq\u012bf, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) divided the spoils he seized from this battle between the Muslims, preferring some of them over others. He gave some of them a hundred camels and others less than that. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) gave a hundred camels to Abu Sufy\u0101n ibn Harb, the Quraysh leader, Safw\u0101n ibn' Umayyah, who had embraced Islam after the Conquest of Makkah and was one of the Quraysh notables during J\u0101hiliyyah and Islam, 'Uyaynah ibn Hisn al-Faz\u0101ri, who had embraced Islam before the Conquest of Makkah and was marked by the typical roughness of desert dwellers, and Al-Aqra' ibn H\u0101bis at-Tam\u012bmi, who had come to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and partook in the Conquest of Makkah, and he was an arbitrator during J\u0101hiliyyah; he gave each one of these persons a hundred camels. On the other hand, he gave \u2018Abb\u0101s ibn Mird\u0101s less than a hundred. So, \u2018Abb\u0101s ibn Mird\u0101s became angry and said these poetic verses: \"You allot the share of my booty and that of Al-\u2018Ubayd between \u2018Uyaynah and Al-Aqra\u2018\" Booty: the spoils. Al-\u2018Ubayd: the name of the horse of \u2018Abb\u0101s ibn Mird\u0101s. The meaning: Do you give the booty which I took part in seizing from Hunayn with my weapon and horse to \u2018Uyaynah ibn Hisn and Al-Aqra\u2018 ibn H\u0101bis and the like of them, by giving them more than me?! By his words \"Both Badr and H\u0101bis\", he meant the grandfather of \u2018Uyaynah and the father of Al-Aqra\u2018. \u2018Uyaynah is the son of Hisn ibn Hudhayfah ibn Badr, and Al-Aqra\u2018 is the son of H\u0101bis. And his words: \"in no way surpassed Mird\u0101s in the assembly\". Surpass means: is higher than. Assembly: the meeting place of the clans and tribes. \"I am in no way inferior to any one of these two\" The meaning: My father was not inferior to theirs, neither am I inferior to them. He seemed to have been gripped with fear that his status might be lowered. Therefore, he said: \"And he whom you lower today\" by decreasing his share of the booty \"will not be elevated\", i.e., the people will not elevate him after this day.\nSo, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) gave him a hundred camels like the others who were given a hundred, so as to win his heart and dispel the thought of inferiority or that he might be lower in rank than others.\nThe Had\u012bth shows how the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would win the hearts of some people with money for an apparent interest.\nThe ruler may prefer some over others if he sees a certain benefit in doing so.\nIt is permissible to recite poetry and is permissible to listen to it.."}, {"number": 365, "hadith": "Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd reported:  The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) mentioned a people who would be among his Ummah, who would emerge out of the dissension of people. Their distinctive mark would be shaven heads. He said: \"They would be the worst creatures - or among the worst creatures. The nearer of the two groups, the truth would kill them.\" The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) gave an example of them, or he said: \"A man throws an arrow at the prey - Or he said: at the target - and looks at the arrowhead and finds no trace, and he looks at the body and finds no trace. Then, he looks at the grip and finds no trace.\" He said: Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd said: \"And you killed them, O people of Iraq.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) warned us against religious innovations and extremism, for it leads to the corruption of societies. Extremism, along with the lack of proper understanding of the religion, may result in considering the Muslim communities as people of religious innovations and Kufr (disbelief) and lead to revolt against the rulers unjustly.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) mentioned a group who would be among his Ummah, meaning the Ummah of those who became Muslims. They are Muslims and would emerge at a time of dissension and discord arising among the Muslims. \"Their distinctive mark would be shaven heads\", i.e., one of their distinguishing signs is that they shave their heads and remove their hair, or the hair of their heads in particular. This indicates their renouncement of worldly embellishments. They are the most evil creatures, or he said: \"among the worst creatures\". This is because they are the people who cause evil and corruption among the people in the land. When fighting between them and the people broke out, the closer group to the truth among the two conflicting groups would kill them. Their first emergence occurred during the caliphate of \u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib (may Allah be pleased with him), and he, along with those with him, fought against them.\n\"The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) gave an example of them, or he said, \"meaning that he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) likened them, with regard to their departure from the religion, to a man who shoots an arrow at the prey. \"Or he said: at the target\", i.e., the object shot at, which includes prey and other things. When he throws an arrow at the prey and examines the arrowhead - which is the sharpened, pointed, solid tip of the arrow - he finds no trace of blood on it. Then, the archer examines it more carefully so that he may find what he seeks. So, he looks at the body and finds no trace of blood. And he looks at \"the grip\", in which the bowstring is placed, and does not find any trace of blood. So, they come out of the religion like a fast arrow that hits the prey, enters it, and comes out so fast that no trace from the prey can stick to it, given its incredible speed. Likewise, they quickly enter the religion and adopt an approach of strictness in it, and they do not take anything from it; instead, they are quick to depart from it.\nAbu Sa\u2018\u012bd (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"And you killed them, O people of Iraq\", referring to the battle of Nahraw\u0101n, 38 A.H., in which \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) fought and defeated them.\nThe Had\u012bth contains one of the signs of the Prophet's prophethood, as he informed us about the trials that would take place after his death, which happened as he told.\nIt warns against following the misguided group(s) that is out of the fold of Islam.\nIt also demonstrates the distinguishing signs and marks of the Kharijites.."}, {"number": 366, "hadith": "Zayd ibn Wahb al-Juhani reported  that he was in the army led by \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) that set out to fight the Kharijites. \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"O people, I heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say: 'There would arise within my Ummah a people who would recite the Qur\u2019an, and your recitation would be nothing compared to their recitation, your prayer would be nothing compared to their prayer, and your fast would be nothing compared to their fast. They would recite the Qur\u2019an thinking that it supports them, whereas it is against them. Their prayer does not get beyond their collarbones. They would pass through Islam as an arrow passes through the prey. If the army that is to encounter them were to know what had been decreed for them by the tongue of their Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), they would completely rely upon that and cease to work. The sign of this is that there would be among them a man with an upper arm and without an arm, and the head of his upper arm would be like the nipple of the breast on which there would be some white hairs.' So, will you go to Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah and the people of the Levant and leave them behind among your children and your property?! By Allah, I hope they are those people, for they have shed inviolable blood and raided the animals of the people. So, go forth in the name of Allah.\" Salamah ibn Kuhayl said: Zayd ibn Wahb made me alight at a place, till we crossed a bridge. When we encountered them - and \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn Wahb ar-R\u0101sibi was the leader of the Kharijites on that day - he said to them: \"Throw the spears and draw out your swords from their sheaths, for I fear that they would appeal to you as they appealed to you on the day of Har\u016br\u0101'.\" They went back and threw their spears and drew out their swords, and people fought against them with their spears and they were killed on top of one another. Only two men were killed from among the people on that day. Then, \u2018Ali (Allah be pleased with him) said: \"Search for the Mukhdaj (the maimed one) among them.\" They searched but did not find him. So, \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) himself stood up till he came upon people who had been killed on top of one another. He said: \"Move them away from one another.\" So, they found him near the ground. Thereupon, he proclaimed Takb\u012br and then said: \"Allah told the truth, and His Messenger conveyed it.\" He said: Then, \u2018Ab\u012bdah as-Salm\u0101ni stood before him and said: \"O Commander of the Believers, by Allah, other than Whom there is no god, did you hear this Had\u012bth from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him)?\" He said: \"Yes, by Allah, other than Whom there is no god.\" He repeated the request for an oath from him three times, and he swore each time..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) warned us against religious innovations and extremism, for it leads to the corruption of societies. Extremism, along with the lack of proper understanding of the religion, may result in considering the Muslim communities as people of religious innovations and Kufr (disbelief) and lead to revolt against the rulers unjustly.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Zayd ibn Wahb al-Juhani relates that he was with \u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib (may Allah be pleased with him) in the army that marched toward the Kharijites. This happened in 38 A.H., in the battle of Nahraw\u0101n, located nearly 35km southeast of Baghdad, Iraq. They were those who criticized \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) for the arbitration over his fighting against Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah (may Allah be pleased with him), and they fought him and declared the Muslims as disbelievers and regarded the shedding of their blood as lawful. \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) addressed his army to make them firm and urge them to fight and display patience in doing so. He informed that he heard the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) point out some traits of the Kharijites, mentioning that they would be a people within the Muslim Ummah, and they would \"recite the Qur'an,\" i.e., recite it a lot. They would also perform prayer and observe fast often, to the extent that if people compared their condition to the condition of others, they would regard the worship of others as nothing next to them. \"They would recite the Qur'an thinking that it supports them\", i.e., it provides an argument for them in proving their claims, whereas this is not the case in reality; instead, it serves as an argument against them with Allah Almighty. In the Two Sah\u012bh Collections, in a Had\u012bth reported by Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him): \"It does not get beyond their collarbones.\" Likewise, their prayer does not get beyond their collarbones. Prayer here probably refers to the recitation in prayer. The collarbone is the bone that extends from the neck cavity to the shoulder. They do not understand the Qur\u2019an, draw benefit from its recitation, ponder its verses, or reflect upon its meanings. So, they do not reach their hearts through reflection and Khush\u016b\u2018 (humility and focus) and do not ascend to heaven. Therefore, they obtain no reward for them. \"They would pass through\" i.e., they would depart from Islam quickly and not get attached to anything in it, just as an arrow passes through prey, i.e., like a powerful and fast arrow that penetrates the target and passes through prey, due to its power and speed, entering from one side and coming out from the opposite one; and it leaves no trace of blood or flesh. Then, they would not go back to the religion, as the arrow does not go back to its place in the bow.\nThen, \u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib (may Allah be pleased with him) states that if the army that would kill and defeat them were to know the reward and recompense that their Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informed them about and determined for them, they would abandon work and solely rely upon this glad tiding which was given to them for killing the Kharijites.\nThe distinctive mark of those Kharijites is \"that there would be among them a man with an upper arm\", which extends from the shoulder to the elbow, \"and without an arm\", which extends from the elbow to the hand. And the head of his upper arm would be like \"the nipple of the breast\", and there would also be some white hairs on the top of his upper arm.\nThen, \u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib (may Allah be pleased with him) expressed criticism of the army in the form of questioning: Do you want to go to Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah and the people of the Levant and fight them and leave those Kharijites behind to stay among your women and children and loot your property?! The meaning: This is not proper and should not happen. By this, he intended to urge them to fight the Kharijites first before marching toward Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah and the people of the Levant.\nThen, \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) swore, saying: \"By Allah, I hope they are those people\" who are amongst us, revolted against us, and departed from obedience to us, \"the people\" whom the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) described to us. Indeed, they went to extremes in shedding the blood of Muslims, and it is blood whose shedding is forbidden. They killed 'Abdull\u0101h ibn Khabb\u0101b and the mother of his child. \"and they raided the animals of the people\", i.e., they raided people's property and stole their grazing livestock. Then, \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"So, go forth in the name of Allah\", i.e., with the blessing of the name of Allah, seek help from Him and put your trust in Him. This indicates that actions should begin with the mention of Allah.\nSalamah ibn Kuhayl al-Hadrami al-K\u016bfi - one of the Had\u012bth narrators - informs that the T\u0101bi\u2018i Zayd ibn Wahb mentioned to him the locations of their travel to fight the Kharijites, one by one, until they reached the bridge at which the fighting took place - the bridge of Dizj\u0101n. This is also mentioned in As-Sunan Al-Kubra Collection of An-Nas\u0101\u2019i. A bridge is a structure built over water for crossing on it. This is the bridge of Nahraw\u0101n, where the Kharijites gathered.\nZayd ibn Wahb related that when the two armies encountered each other for fighting, the leader of the Kharijites on that day was \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn Wahb ar-R\u0101sibi, who said to the Kharijites: Throw the spears and draw out your swords from their sheaths. He wanted the two armies to start fighting. Thus, there would be no possible alternative to fighting, such as a truce or appeal, which means that they would ask and adjure them by Allah, and this might cause some of his companions to leave him, and, as a result, his army would become weaker. Confrontation with spears puts the two armies at a distance from each other, and this carries the possibility that some of them may feel pity upon seeing the blood and call for the cessation of fighting. On the other hand, fighting with the swords breaks out quickly and ends with defeating one of the two armies. Ibn Wahb hoped that he would be victorious in this battle. \"as they appealed to you on the day of Har\u016br\u0101\u2019.\" This is a village near Kufa, after which a sect of the Khrijites was named, as their first gathering took place there, \"the day\" here refers to the day in which the Kharijites gathered, numbering eight thousand - and a different number was also mentioned - and they alighted at Har\u016br\u0101\u2019. Their leaders were \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn al-Kaww\u0101\u2019 al-Yashkuri and Shabath at-Tam\u012bmi. \u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib (may Allah be pleased with him) sent his cousin \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) to them. He debated with them, and as a result, many of them came back with him. Then, \u2018Ali went out to them, appealed to them, and engaged in a discussion with them. Consequently, they obeyed him and entered Kufa along with him.\nWhen the Kharijites listened to \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn Wahb, they obeyed him and \"threw their spears\" i.e. they threw them away and engaged in fighting against the army of \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) with swords. So, this opinion led to victory for the Muslims and \u2018Ali's army, the preservation of their blood, and their empowerment. \"and people fought against them with their spears\" i.e., the companions of \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) stabbed them with their spears like trees. The Arabic text uses a verb derived from 'shajar', which means trees. So, the companions of \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) threw the spears at them before they could reach them. Then, they engaged in battle with them and killed so many of them; only two men were killed on the side of \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him). His words \"they were killed on top of one another\" mean that they were piled upon one another due to the large number of them who were killed, forming heaps.\nThen, after the end of the battle, \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) ordered them to search for \"the Mukhdaj\" man, i.e., his body is incomplete. This is the man described at the beginning of the Had\u012bth. They searched for him but could not find him. So, 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) himself rose and moved to a heap of dead bodies from the Kharijites. He ordered that they be separated from one another, and they found underneath them the man he was looking for dead. Thereupon, 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) proclaimed Takb\u012br in wonder at seeing the Mukhdaj man with the description given by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Then, he said after the Takb\u012br: \"Allah\", Exalted be He, \"told the truth\" in what He revealed to His Prophet; \"and His Messenger conveyed\" His message to us and to the people, in truth.\nThen, Zayd ibn Wahb al-Juhani informed that the T\u0101bi\u2018i \u2018Ab\u012bdah as-Salm\u0101ni called out to \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him): \"O Commander of the Believers\", and he adjured him by Allah, other than Whom there is no god, to tell him whether he heard this Had\u012bth from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). In response, \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) swore, saying: \"Yes, by Allah, other than Whom there is no god\" i.e., yes, I heard it from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). \"He repeated the request for an oath from him three times\". He asked him to swear to let this be heard by the people present and affirm that to them, and in order to reveal to them the miracle informed by the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and show them that \u2018Ali and his Companions are the worthier among the two groups in claiming the truth, and that they are rightful in fighting them.\nThe Had\u012bth points to the danger of ignorance in religion and dogmatic thinking.\nIt mentions the great reward of killing the Kharijites.\nIt warns against extremism in religion and affectation in worship.\nThose who revolt against the just rulers should be fought against.\nThe Had\u012bth mentions some traits of the Kharijites.\nIt shows the merit of \u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib (may Allah be pleased with him).\nAn oath may be requested for verifying something unfamiliar, so as to affirm it to those who hear about it.."}, {"number": 367, "hadith": "Abu Dharr reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"Verily, there is from my Ummah after me - or there would be from my Ummah after me - a people who would recite the Qur\u2019an, but it would not go beyond their throats, and they would pass through the religion as an arrow passes through the prey, and then they would not come back to it; they are the worst among the creation and the creatures.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informed the Companions about many of the trials that took place during their generation and that would take place after their generation. One of the trials they witnessed during their time was the trial of the Kharijites.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) made reference to that. He mentioned people who would be in his Ummah after him; among their characteristics is that they \"would recite the Qur'an, but it would not go beyond their throats.\" They recite the Qur'an but do not get affected by it, understand it, or act upon its verses. So, they will not be recompensed for that by rewards, and their recitation does not go beyond their tongues, so no good deed is accepted from them. This is not something required; instead, it is required to ponder and reflect upon the Qur'an as it influences the heart. This all means that Im\u0101n (faith) did not settle firmly in their hearts. \"they would pass through the religion as an arrow passes through the prey, and then they would not come back to it\", i.e., they come out of the religion like the coming out of a fast arrow, which hits the prey and enters and comes out of it with a high speed, without any trace of the prey sticking to it; this is due to its quick coming out of the target. The \"ramiyyah\" (prey) is the animal that is hunted and hit with an arrow after getting chased. This is a description of the Kharijites, who do not obey the rulers and revolt against them and declare people as disbelievers on account of major sins that are below Shirk (polytheism) and Kufr (disbelief). They kill the people of Islam and leave the people of idols (disbelievers). After all that, they do not return to the religion again, as they do not repent or reconsider their matter. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) remarked: \"They are the worst among the creation and the creatures.\" It is said: \"Khalq\" (creation) refers to humankind, and \"khaliqah\" (creatures) refers to animals. It is also said: They both have the same meaning. So, this refers to all creation. They are the worst among all creation because they fight the best people, thus corrupting the land after it was in good condition.\nThe Had\u012bth includes one of the Prophet's prophecies, as he told about something that would happen after his death, and it did happen as he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informed.\nIt warns against misunderstanding the Qur\u2019an and not pondering its verses, goals, and objectives; and it points out that this causes corruption on earth.\nIt also indicates that one of the consequences of poor reflection upon the verses of Allah is to depart from the religion.."}, {"number": 368, "hadith": "Sahl ibn Han\u012bf reported: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"A people will go astray toward the east, with shaven heads.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was keen on teaching his Ummah and warning them against trials. A true Muslim ponders the Prophet's statements and teachings and tries his best to save himself and his Muslim community from falling into misleading trials.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informs that there will emerge a group of people who will deviate from the true and correct path and go astray in the darkness of religious innovations and misguidance. They will never be guided to the truth; they will be lost and follow the wrong paths. They will emerge from the east, which refers to the direction of the sunrise. Those people who go astray from the true path are described as having shaven heads, which indicates their abandonment and renouncement of worldly life. The intended meaning is that shaving their heads was a habit that they persistently engaged in and for which they were known. This trait was mentioned with regard to the Kharijites, that they are marked by shaving their heads, until it became a slogan for them, by which they were identified.\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) warns his Ummah in this Had\u012bth against the trial of going astray in misguidance and tells us about the signs of deviation.\nOne of the signs of deviation and misguidance is leading a life of false asceticism.."}, {"number": 369, "hadith": "\u2018Abdul-Muttalib ibn Rab\u012b\u2018ah ibn al-H\u0101rith reported:  Rab\u012b\u2018ah ibn al-H\u0101rith and Al-\u2018Abb\u0101s ibn \u2018Abdul-Muttalib got together and said: \"By Allah, if we sent these two young men - I and Al-Fadl ibn al-\u2018Abb\u0101s - to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and they spoke to him, he would put them in charge of these Zakah funds, and they would pay as the people pay and get a share as the people get.\" He said: As they were talking about that, 'Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib came and stood before them, and they mentioned it to him. Thereupon, \u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib said: \"Do not do this, for, by Allah, he would not do that.\" Rab\u012b\u2018ah ibn al-H\u0101rith turned to him and said: \"By Allah, you are only doing this out of jealousy toward us. By Allah, you became the son-in-law of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), but we felt no jealousy toward you.\" 'Ali said: \"Send them.\" So, they set out, and 'Ali lay on the bed. He said: When the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) offered the Zhuhr prayer, we went ahead of him to his room and stood near it till he came, took hold of our ears, and then said: \"Take out what you keep within yourselves.\" Then, he entered, and we entered his place. He was on that day in the house of Zaynab bint Jahsh. He said: We urged each of us to speak. Then, one of us spoke, saying: \"O Messenger of Allah, you are the most righteous and the best of people in upholding kinship ties. We have reached the marriageable age. We have come so that you may put us in charge of some of these Zakah funds, and we would submit them to you as the people submit and get a share as they get.\" He said: He kept silent for a long time until we wished to speak with him. He said: Zaynab pointed to us from behind the curtain, telling us not to talk to him. He said: Then, he said: \"Zakah does not befit the family of Muhammad, for it is the impurities of people. Call Mahmiyah to me - and he was in charge of the Khums funds - and Nawfal ibn al-H\u0101rith ibn' Abdul-Muttalib.\" They both came to him, and he said to Mahmiyah: \"Marry your daughter to this young man\", i.e., Al-Fadl ibn' Abb\u0101s. He married her to him. And he said to Nawfal ibn al-H\u0101rith: \"Marry your daughter to this young man\", i.e., me. He married her to me. And he said to Mahmiyah: \"Pay such and such from the Khums funds as a dowry on behalf of both of them.\".", "commentary": "Allah Almighty honored His Prophet and the believing members of his household and purified them of all filth and impurities. An example is that Zakah is forbidden for the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his household. They may not take from it or accept it.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Abdul-Muttalib ibn Rab\u012b\u2018ah ibn al-H\u0101rith (may Allah be pleased with him) informs that Rab\u012b\u2018ah ibn al-H\u0101rith, the Prophet's cousin, met with his uncle Al-\u2018Abb\u0101s ibn \u2018Abdul-Muttalib, the Prophet's uncle, and they said: By Allah, if we sent these two young men - meaning: 'Abdul-Muttalib ibn Rab\u012b\u2018ah and Al-Fadl ibn' Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with them) - to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and they talked to him, and he appointed them as Zakah collectors, and they would submit as the people submit and get a share like the people, as a wage for the Zakah work. They wanted this money to help them get married, as they reached the marriageable age and could not afford marriage, as narrated in the version by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd. As Al-\u2018Abb\u0101s and Rab\u012b\u2018ah (may Allah be pleased with both of them) were talking and discussing this matter, \u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib (may Allah be pleased with him), also a cousin of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), came and stood before them. They mentioned to him what they were discussing and told him about what they intended to do. So, \u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib (may Allah be pleased with him) forbade them from doing that and swore that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would not agree to their request in this regard. Thereupon, Rab\u012b\u2018ah turned to \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) and said to him tough words and swore that he did not forbid them from sending the two young men and asking the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to put them in charge of Zakah funds except because of jealousy toward them and his desire to be the only one among them with closeness to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Then, he swore by Allah to \u2018Ali that he won the relationship with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) by marriage - meaning his marriage to his daughter F\u0101timah (may Allah be pleased with her) - and they felt no jealousy toward him because of that. When \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) heard that from him, he asked them to send them so that they could be certain about his advice to them. \"and \u2018Ali lay on the bed.\" In another version by Muslim: \"'Ali threw his cloak and lay on it, and he said: I am the father of Hasan, and I am the Qarm (chief). By Allah, I would not move from my place till your sons return to you with the reply to that for which you sent them to the Messenger of Allah the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\" Qarm: the stud among animals. It refers to a master and chief who possesses knowledge and wise judgment. He (may Allah be pleased with him) meant: I spoke what I said to you from knowledge, and I would not move from my place, and I would wait for the reply they would come with from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). He knew that the reply would be as he told them.\nSo, \u2018Abdul-Muttalib and Al-Fadl (may Allah be pleased with both of them) left and headed to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). 'Abdul-Muttalib (may Allah be pleased with him) informs that when the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) performed the Zhuhr prayer, they went ahead of him to the room he would enter after the prayer, and that was the room of the Mother of the Believers Zaynab bint Jahsh (may Allah be pleased with her). They waited for him at the door till the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came, took hold of their ears by way of jesting, and then said: \"Take out what you keep within yourselves\" i.e., the talk you harbor within your chests. Then, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) entered his room, and they entered after him so as to proceed with their talk and let him hear them. Each of them wanted the other to start the talk with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in awe of him. Then, one of them talked. He said to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): \"O Messenger of Allah, you are the most benevolent of all people\", i.e., the best among people in benevolence and doing good to others. \"and the best of people in upholding kinship ties\" i.e., you are most keen on maintaining the ties of kinship. \"We have reached the marriageable age.\" Thus, they presented the reason for their following requests. \"We have come so that you may put us in charge of\" collecting \"some of these Zakah funds\", which are to be calculated and taken from money owners and kept and given to you and distributed to the due recipients. \"and we would submit to you as the people submit\" i.e., we would transfer the Zakah funds and hand them over to you like others. \"and get a share as they get\" as a wage for the Zakah work. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) remained silent for so long that they wanted to repeat their speech and request. Meanwhile, Zaynab bint Jahsh (may Allah be pleased with her) began to point to them with her garment or hand from behind the curtain to not talk to him. After his long silence, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) made clear to them that Zakah may not be given to the household of Muhammad, i.e., it is forbidden for him and his family, whether it is given for work or because of poverty, destitution, or some other reason. \"for it is the impurities of people\", i.e., it purifies their wealth from the sin of hoarding and their souls from the sin of stinginess. Or it is the impurities of people because it expiates for sins, removes afflictions, and acts as a ransom for the person in this regard. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ordered them to call Mahmiyah ibn Jaz\u2019 ibn \u2018Abd Yagh\u016bt az-Zubaydi (may Allah be pleased with him) to him. He was a man from Banu Asad, and the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had put him in charge of the Khums (one-fifth of the spoils), and to call Nawfal ibn al-H\u0101rith ibn \u2018Abdul-Muttalib, the brother of Rab\u012b\u2018ah ibn al-H\u0101rith. Mahmiyah and Nawfal came and appeared before the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ordered Mahmiyah ibn Jaz' to marry his daughter to Al-Fadl ibn' Abb\u0101s, which Mahmiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) did. And he ordered Nawfal ibn al-H\u0101rith to marry his daughter to Rab\u012b\u2018ah ibn al-H\u0101rith. Both of them (may Allah be pleased with both of them) complied. Mahmiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) was in charge of the Prophet's expenses from the Khums. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ordered him to pay an amount which he specified for him as a dowry on behalf of each of them to his wife. The Khums refers to the share of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in the spoils, as revealed in the verse that reads: {Know that whatever spoils you obtain, one-fifth belongs to Allah and the Messenger, his close relatives, the orphans, the needy and the [stranded] travelers.} [Surat al-Anf\u0101l: 41]\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that Zakah funds are to be paid to the ruler and the authority holder.\nIt shows the Prophet's modesty and cheerfulness and how he would jest with and show compassion toward the young.\nWords of praise may be said before asking for something.\nThe Had\u012bth mentions that it is forbidden to give Zakah to the household of Muhammad (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\nIt indicates that the Prophet's household were not employed for the collection of charity and Zakah.\nIt also shows that a person should seek to obtain the wherewithal for marriage.\nIt demonstrates a father's interest in helping his son get married to maintain his chastity.\nThe Had\u012bth also points out the merit of \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), as he was more knowledgeable about this matter than those Companions (may Allah be pleased with them).\nAnd it shows the extreme politeness of Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her) as she pointed to the two young men not to repeat the speech to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).."}, {"number": 370, "hadith": "Kurayb reported:  that \u2019Umm al-Fadl sent him to Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah in the Levant.

Then, I came to Mad\u012bnah at the end of the month. \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) asked me about the sighting of the moon and said: \"When did you see the crescent?\" I said: \"We saw it on the night of Friday.\" He said: \"Did you see it yourself?\" I said: \"Yes, and the people saw it and fasted and so did Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah.\" He said: \"But we saw it on the night of Saturday; so, we will continue fasting until we have completed thirty days, or we see it.\" I said: \"Will you not be content with the sighting of Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah and his fasting?\" He said: \"No, this is what the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) enjoined upon us.\" Yahya ibn Yahya was doubtful about whether it is \"Will we not be content?\" or \"Will you not be content?\".", "commentary": "Allah made crescents a means for counting months and years. By sighting the crescent, one month begins and another ends. Based on this sighting, many obligations are determined, like fasting and Hajj.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Kurayb ibn Abi Muslim says that \u2019Umm al-Fadl Lub\u0101bah bint al-H\u0101rith, the wife of Al-\u2018Abb\u0101s ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib and the mother of \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn al-\u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with them), sent him to Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah ibn Abi Sufy\u0101n (may Allah be pleased with him), who was then the caliph of Muslims. Kurayb went to the Levant and finished her errand. Then, the crescent of the month of Ramadan appeared while he was in the Levant. The crescent was sighted on the night of Friday. There are over 1,120km between the Levant and Mad\u012bnah, the center of the caliphate during the era of Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah ibn Abi Sufy\u0101n, from which the state was run, and which was followed by all the Muslim provinces.\nThen, Kurayb said that he went back to Mad\u012bnah once again at the end of the month of Ramadan. \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) asked him about the journey and the fulfillment of his mother's errand. Then, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) mentioned the crescent and asked him: When did you see the crescent in the Levant? Kurayb told him that they saw it on the night of Friday. Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) further asked: \"Did you see it\" with your own eyes? In response, Kurayb said: Yes, and the people also saw it, and they fasted and so did Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah (may Allah be pleased with him). Thereupon, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s said: \"But we saw it on the night of Saturday,\" i.e., one night after it was sighted in the Levant. Therefore, we will continue to fast until we complete the thirty days of the month or see the crescent before that with the month being 29 days. This results from the different sightings of crescents from different places. So, Kurayb asked Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him): Will you - or he said: will we - not be content with the sighting by the people of the Levant of the crescent of Ramadan at its beginning, and with them is Caliph Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah ibn Abi Sufy\u0101n (may Allah be pleased with him)? Thus, you fast with their fasting at the start of the month and break your fast with their break of the fast. In reply, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s said: 'No' i.e., we are not content with their sighting. Rather, we observe the fast or complete the month according to our sighting. He probably said that given the great distance between Hejaz and the Levant which allows for different crescent sightings. Also, news could not reach Mad\u012bnah from the Levant on the same night. Hence, they comply with the Prophet's command to observe the fast and break the fast based on sighting the crescent. In a Had\u012bth narrated by Al-Bukh\u0101ri and Muslim, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Fast when you see it and break your fast when you see it, and if the weather is cloudy, complete it as thirty.\" This does not exclusively pertain to the people of a certain region; rather, it is addressed to all Muslims.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that we must rely on sighting the crescents to know the beginnings and ends of the lunar months.\nIt also points out that the people of each region should fast based on their sighting of the crescent.."}, {"number": 371, "hadith": "Abu al-Bakhtari reported:  We saw the crescent of Ramadan while we were at Dh\u0101t \u2018Irq.

This is the one about which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Do not be misled with regard to your Suh\u016br by the Adh\u0101n of Bil\u0101l or the whiteness of the horizon that grows long in this way.\" This teaches the Muslims that they may eat and drink when they hear the Adh\u0101n of Bil\u0101l, for it was only intended to give notice that the time of Fajr was approaching. The Adh\u0101n of Bil\u0101l was proclaimed at the time when the whiteness of the horizon grows long in the sky. And it was meant to make the sleeping person wake up and alert the one standing in prayer. It was followed by the second Adh\u0101n, which was proclaimed by Ibn \u2019Umm Makt\u016bm. Upon hearing it, the people would abstain from food and drink and start fasting.\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) directed the people to the sign of the true dawn.

This is because Allah made permissible for us some of what He has prohibited for them. So, our difference from them in this regard represents gratitude for this favor. They do not have a Suh\u016br meal, while we are enjoined to have it.

It is authentically reported in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections that he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would spend the night with his Lord so Allah would provide him with food and drink. This stems from the Prophet's complete compassion and mercy toward his Ummah and his fear that they might get bored of worship and fall short of some tasks of the religion. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) swore to them: \"By Allah, if the month were lengthened for me\" i.e., if the days of the month of Ramadan increased, as they sighted the crescent one or two days after their observance of Wis\u0101l, according to a Had\u012bth narrated in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections and reported by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him). \"I would observe Wis\u0101l,\" i.e., he would continue this Wis\u0101l of his, \"in a way that would make those who act with exaggeration\", those who overburden themselves, adopt a strict approach, and oblige themselves to do things that were not prescribed for them, \"abandon their exaggeration.\" i.e., so that they would abandon it because of tiredness and hardship, and thus they would themselves be sure of the leniency of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) toward them when he prohibited them from Wis\u0101l. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would indeed increase Wis\u0101l for them to deter and punish them for their lack of compliance with his command (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\nThe Had\u012bth points out the Prophet's leniency toward his Ummah and that he would not burden them with things beyond their capacity.\nIt warns of exaggeration in the acts of worship.\nAnd it warns against overburdening oneself with supererogatory acts of worship.."}, {"number": 376, "hadith": "\u2018Umar ibn Abi Salamah reported that he asked the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him):  \"Can a fasting person kiss?\" The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: \"Ask her\" (\u2019Umm Salamah).

In response, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: \"Indeed, by Allah, I am the most heedful and fearful of Allah among you\" i.e., I am the most knowledgeable among you of what I do in heedfulness of Allah Almighty and the most fearful among you of His punishment. So, how would you think of me, or see it as possible, that I may engage in something prohibited?! This denotes criticism of those who thought he might fall short in worship due to reliance upon the forgiveness of his sins.\nIt is said: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) referred 'Umar ibn Abi Salamah (may Allah be pleased with him), concerning this question, to his mother, whereas during J\u0101hiliyyah, a person would not allude to the son or brother of his wife that he kissed or approached her intimately. And indeed, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) is more exalted with regard to refraining from that. But, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) wanted to point out that their refrainment from that during J\u0101hiliyyah was frivolous behavior on their part and unrelated to the Shariah. So, he referred him to his mother.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that kissing during the fast is not part of the peculiar traits of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).."}, {"number": 377, "hadith": "\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported:  that a man came to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), asking him for a Fatwa while she was hearing from behind the door, he said: \"O Messenger of Allah, the prayer becomes due upon me while I am Junub (ritually impure); should I fast?\" The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"The prayer also becomes due upon me while I am Junub, and I observe fast.\" He said: \"You are not like us, O Messenger of Allah, for Allah forgave your past and future sins for you.\" Thereupon, he said: \"By Allah, I hope I am the most fearful of Allah among you and the most knowledgeable among you of the things I should be heedful of.\".", "commentary": "Fasting has specific rulings that a Muslim must know and act upon. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) demonstrated its obligatory elements, Sunnahs, and disliked things by words and deeds.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Mother of the Believers \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) relates that a man came to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asking him about something relating to the purification of the fasting person from Jan\u0101bah (major ritual impurity). Meanwhile, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was behind the door, hearing. The man told the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) that the Fajr prayer would sometimes become due while he was Junub; so, should he observe fast while in this state of Jan\u0101bah and take a bath after that? Jan\u0101bah refers to the state after someone ejaculates semen or engages in sexual intercourse. It is called such because of Ijtin\u0101b (avoidance) of prayer and worship till getting purified from it. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: \"The prayer also becomes due upon me while I am Junub, and I observe fast.\" He (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) responded to him by action, for it is more profound than saying: Take a bath and observe fast. This demonstrates the legitimacy of fasting by a Junub person before he bathes. This is because the occurrence of Jan\u0101bah before Fajr does not prevent the intention of fasting or make it invalid. The man said: \"You are not like us, O Messenger of Allah, for Allah forgave your past and future sins for you\" i.e., this is one of your peculiar traits, and you are not to blame for what you do. In the version by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd: \"So, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) got angry.\" Indeed, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) got angry because this man regarded that as a peculiar trait for him without knowledge, though the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informed him about his action in response to his question. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: \"By Allah, I hope I am the most fearful of Allah among you\", i.e., that I am the most fearful among you of His punishment, \"and the most knowledgeable among you of the things I should be heedful of\" i.e., that I am the most knowledgeable among you of that by which I heed Allah Almighty. The hope of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would surely materialize, by consensus. This involves criticism of those who attribute to him neglect in worship for reliance upon the forgiveness of his sins.."}, {"number": 378, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) left for Makkah during the year of the Conquest, in Ramadan, and he fasted until he reached Kur\u0101\u2018 al-Gham\u012bm, and so the people fasted. Then, he called for a cup of water, which he elevated so that the people could see it, and then he drank. Afterwards, it was said to him: Some of the people fasted. Thereupon, he said: \"Those are the disobedient ones, those are the disobedient ones.\" [Another version adds]: It was said to him: Fasting has become too difficult for the people, and indeed they are watching you to see what you will do. So, he called for a cup of water after \u2018Asr..", "commentary": "Jihad and being in a battle are among the situations that require all the meanings of good health and strength, particularly upon encountering the enemy. A traveler is given a dispensation not to fast, so that he can have the strength to travel. And there is a greater reason for refraining from fasting during Jihad, as it needs more strength.\nIn this Had\u012bth, J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) set out during the year of the Conquest, in 8 A.H., intending to conquer Makkah, during Ramadan. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and the army with him were fasting, until he reached \"Kur\u0101\u2018 al-Gham\u012bm\", the name of a place between Makkah and Mad\u012bnah. Al-Gham\u012bm: a valley 8 miles (nearly 13km) opposite \u2018Usf\u0101n, and 64km away from Makkah on the way to Mad\u012bnah. It is known today as Barq\u0101\u2019 al-Gham\u012bm. Al-Kur\u0101\u2018: a black mountain connected to it.\nWhen he arrived there, he called for a cup of water and raised it to his mouth until the people looked at him. In a version: \"Fasting has become too difficult for the people, and indeed they are watching you to see what you will do\" in terms of fasting or breaking the fast. \"So, he called for a cup of water after \u2018Asr.\" This version clarifies that fasting exhausted the people and they were waiting for the Prophet's order regarding this matter. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) called for water after \u2018Asr and drank from it, so that the people would follow his example and break their fast. He (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) sought leniency and ease for them, in line with the verse that reads: {But if anyone is ill or on a journey, he should make up for those days. Allah wants ease for you and does not want hardship for you.} [Surat al-Baqarah: 185] Allah Almighty informs that, by breaking the fast during travel, He wants to facilitate things for His servants.\nThereafter, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was told that some of the people fasted. Thereupon, he said: \"Those are the disobedient ones; those are the disobedient ones.\" This is because when he gives a command, it must be observed. He would sometimes give commands by his statements and sometimes by his actions. So, when he broke the fast, this constituted a command, indicated by his very condition, aimed at giving a dispensation, so that he could draw strength from breaking the fast and be able to engage in the Jihad he set out for. When those people renounced his action, they were extremely wrong. If they thought that their observance of the fast was better than the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) breaking the fast, this sufficed as an error and lack of understanding on their part. And if they were not aware that their breaking of the fast would make them more capable of Jihad, this was a poor understanding from them. Hence, they were labeled as disobedient because, by doing so, they violated the Shariah and were not flexible to accept it. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) repeated his statement \"those are the disobedient ones\" for emphasis.\nThe Had\u012bth mentions going to battle in Ramadan and the legitimacy of breaking the fast during its daytime, lest the army would be too weak to engage in the war.\nIt indicates the Prophet's complete mercy and compassion toward his Ummah.\nIt demonstrates the necessity of following the Prophet's commands and that whoever disobeys him, due to any standpoint, becomes a disobedient person.\nIt shows the leniency of Islam and the ease of its obligations, as it sanctions breaking the fast for travelers.\nAs it points to the permissibility of breaking the fast during the daytime for a person who intends to fast from the night if something unexpected occurs to him.."}, {"number": 379, "hadith": "Qaz\u2018ah reported: I came to Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) and he was surrounded by people, and when they dispersed, I said to him: \"I am not going to ask you about what these people were asking.\" I asked him about fasting during travel. He said:  We traveled with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to Makkah while we were fasting. We halted at a place. Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"You have neared your enemy and breaking the fast will give you greater strength.\" This was a dispensation. So, some of us continued to observe the fast and some of us broke it. Then, we stopped at another place, and he said: \"You are going to encounter the enemy in the morning and breaking the fast will give you greater strength; so, break the fast.\" This was stressful; so, we broke the fast. Then, he said: I saw us observing the fast with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) during travel after that..", "commentary": "Traveling and encountering the enemy are among the things that require physical strength to endure hardships and difficulties. This Had\u012bth demonstrates some of the dispensations and determinations related to travel by observing the fast therein or breaking it, and the dispensations and determinations upon encountering the enemy in the month of Ramadan and during fasting. The T\u0101bi\u2018i Qaz\u2018ah ibn Yahya al-Basri says that he came to Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) \"and he was surrounded by people\" i.e., a lot of people were around him learning and benefiting from his narration of Had\u012bths. When the people dispersed and departed, he said to Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd (may Allah be pleased with him): I will not ask you about the matters people ask you about. He probably meant that his question was not addressed by Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd (may Allah be pleased with him) before that or no one in this gathering asked him about it. He asked him about the ruling on fasting during travel and the involved dispensations or determinations. Demonstrating their conditions during travel along with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd (may Allah be pleased with him) informed him that they began their journey from Mad\u012bnah for the Conquest of Makkah while fasting during the month of Ramadan. When they stopped at some place for rest, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) told them that they came near the enemy and the war, and that breaking the fast would give them greater strength, as encountering the enemy requires strength, and breaking the fast achieves this purpose more than fasting. This indicates that maintaining strength by refraining from fasting is better for someone expecting to face the enemy.\nHis statement: \"This was a dispensation\" means that they did not take this statement as denoting a binding command for breaking the fast or asking for that firmly. Rather, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) noted that breaking the fast is more appropriate for those apprehensive of weakness. So, some of them observed the fast and some others broke it.\nThen, they halted at another place for rest. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to them: \"You are going to encounter the enemy in the morning\" i.e., you will attack them in the morning. \"and breaking the fast will give you greater strength; so, break the fast.\" Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"This situation was stressful\" i.e., they took his command to break the fast as denoting emphasis and necessity. So, they all broke the fast. This shows that the Companions would understand the objectives of the Prophet's discourse.\nThen, Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd (may Allah be pleased with him) said that they would later fast along with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) during travel, which indicates that the prohibition to observe fasting during their travel for the Conquest of Makkah did not abrogate the permissibility of fasting.

This is because it is a day in which Allah saved Moses (M\u016bsa) (peace be upon him) from Pharaoh and his soldiers. Indeed, the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) mentioned that to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) because it was known that he would mostly intend to differ from the Jews and the Christians.

So, fast it\" i.e., by agreeing with him in gratitude to Allah Almighty and feeling happy for his salvation. This is because the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) accords with him over the basis of the religion. As for the Jews, they engaged in distortion, change, and alteration.

So, he asked him about what he should do: fast it or not? In response, Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"Allah Almighty enjoined the fulfillment of vows,\" which occurs in the verse that reads: {and fulfill their vows.} [Surat al-Hajj: 29] \"and the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade fasting this day\" i.e., fasting the two days of the two Eids. He forbade fasting these two days because they are days of festivity, play, joy, and eating and drinking. Also, Eid al-Fitr is the day of breaking the fast of Ramadan. As for the day of Eid al-Ad'ha, this is intended to enable the Muslim to eat from his sacrificial animal, if he has sacrificed. Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) seemed to have refrained from giving a Fatwa on this issue, considering the conflict between the proofs he had. This was done by way of Tawarru\u2018 (caution) from Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), and he was known for it. And it is said: Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) clarified to him the general ruling and the specific one. So, he should do both things, namely, to not fast the day of Eid, in compliance with the prohibition by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and to fast a day in place of it, given Allah's command to fulfill vows.\nThe Had\u012bth contains the command to fulfill vows.\nIt is prohibited to fast the two days of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Ad'ha.."}, {"number": 383, "hadith": "Nubayshah al-Hudhali reported: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"The Days of Tashr\u012bq are days of eating and drinking.\" [Another version adds: \"and remembrance of Allah.\"].", "commentary": "Islam is the religion of tolerance and ease. It provides much space to the Muslims, so that they can be generous to themselves and their families in eating and drinking during the Eid days.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) says: \"The Days of Tashr\u012bq,\" are the 11th, 12th, and 13th days of Dhul-Hijjah. They were called as such because in these days people used to cure the meat of sacrificial animals and spread them in the sun to dry, which is known as Tashr\u012bq in Arabic. This was their practice during their era. But, nowadays, the meat of sacrificial animals and offerings is available. They are \"days of eating and drinking;\" so, people should eat, drink, and not observe fasting therein. They should also remember Allah, supplicate to Him, and show gratitude to Him for the sustenance and guidance He has bestowed upon them.\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade fasting during the Days of Tashr\u012bq. For example, in a Had\u012bth narrated by Al-Bukh\u0101ri in his Sah\u012bh Collection, Ibn \u2018Umar and \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with both of them) reported: \"No permission was given for fasting during the Days of Tashr\u012bq except for someone who cannot afford the sacrificial animal,\" i.e., to the performer of Tamattu\u2018 or Qir\u0101n Hajj who cannot afford the sacrificial animal. This represents flexibility for the people.\nIn the prohibition of fasting these days and the command to eat and drink lies a good reason. Since Allah Almighty knows that those who come to His House undergo hardships during travel, tiredness because of Ihr\u0101m, and self-struggle while performing the rituals, He prescribed rest for them after that, by staying at Mina on the Day of Nahr and three subsequent days. And He ordered them to eat from the meat of sacrificial animals out of His kindness and mercy towards them, for they are the guests of Allah Almighty therein. He also included the people of other countries with them, for they join them in undergoing hardships for the sake of Allah Almighty, like the hard work they endure during the ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, as they observe fasting, remember Allah, and worship diligently, and in seeking closeness to Allah by slaughtering sacrifices and in the attainment of forgiveness. So, they join them in their Eids, and everyone shares rest by eating and drinking. Thus, all Muslims become the guests of Allah Almighty during these days, eating from His sustenance and showing gratitude to Him for His grace. And since it does not befit the Most Generous to let His guests go hungry, they were forbidden to fast these days.."}, {"number": 384, "hadith": "Ka\u2018b ibn M\u0101lik reported:  that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) sent him and Aws ibn al-Hadath\u0101n during the days of Tashr\u012bq to announce that none will enter Paradise except a believer, and the days of Mina are days of eating and drinking..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to clarify to the Muslims the matters of the religion and give them good news that would gladden them due to the great rewards for the deeds in Islam.

They were given this name because of people's Tashr\u012bq (cutting into long narrow strips) of the meat of sacrificial animals, as they would cut the meat into strips and leave them to dry in the sun. This was their situation in the early stage of Islam. They are also known as the days of Mina. He commanded them to announce to the pilgrims in the Sacred Precincts that \"none will enter Paradise except a believer\" i.e., none will enter Paradise except those who believe in Allah, testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and act according to this \u012am\u0101n. This gives glad tidings to the believers and motivates people to complete the pillars of \u012am\u0101n so that they can win Paradise. And it warns those who did not embrace Islam, and so that the pilgrims will return to their countries and warn the polytheists among their people.\nHe (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) instructed them to announce to the people that the days of Mina are days of eating and drinking. These are the days in which the pilgrims stay in the valley of Mina - located nearly 6km away from the Sacred Mosque - to throw the pebbles. They are the appointed days which Allah mentions in the verse that reads: {And remember Allah during the appointed days. But whoever hastens to depart [Mina] on the second day, there is no sin upon him; and whoever delays [until the third], there is no sin upon him for those who fear Allah.} [Surat al-Baqarah: 203] During these days, the meat of \u2019Ud'hiyah (sacrificial animals by non-pilgrims on Eid al-Ad'ha) and Hady (sacrificial animals by pilgrims) is abundantly available.

And none of them may be singled out for specific times unless it is prescribed in the Shariah.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbids that the night of Friday be singled out for Qiy\u0101m involving prayer and Dhikr apart from the other nights of the week. He also forbade that Friday be singled out for fasting apart from the other days of the week, unless this coincides with a certain fast a Muslim usually observes, such as when he fasts every other day, and the day he fasts coincides with Friday, or he makes a vow and its time happens to coincide with Friday, or other things that oblige him to observe fasting. In the Two Sah\u012bh Collections: \"None of you should fast on Friday unless he fasts a day before or after it.\" So, he should fast on Thursday or Saturday along with it. It is said: The prohibition of singling out Friday and its night for these acts aims at differing from the Jews and the Christians, for the Jews hold that Saturday should be singled out for fasting, out of reverence to it, and the Christians hold that Sunday should be singled out for fasting, out of reverence to it, and its night for Qiy\u0101m al-Layl. Since Friday occupies a status within this Ummah like the status of these two days within the two groups, it is recommended that our practice be different from theirs in the way of revering this day.."}, {"number": 386, "hadith": "Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) reported:  A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and said: \"O Messenger of Allah, my mother passed away and she took an oath to fast, should I fast on her behalf?\" He said: \"Tell me, if there was a debt due on your mother and you settled it, would it be valid on her behalf?\" She replied: 'Yes.' He said: \"So, fast on behalf of your mother.\".", "commentary": "A vow is an act of worship and piety that should not be devoted to anyone other than Allah. In His glorious Book, Allah Almighty praised His pious servants and promised them the reward. Among their attributes which He mentioned is their fulfillment of vows. He says: {They fulfill their vows.} [Surat al-Ins\u0101n: 7]\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that a woman came to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asking him about her mother who had made a vow to fast and died before fulfilling her vow: Is it valid for her to fast on behalf of her mother? The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to her: \"Tell me, if there was a debt due on your mother and you settled it, would it be valid on her behalf?\" This is an affirmative question. She replied: 'Yes, it settles on her behalf.' He said: \"So, fast on behalf of your mother.\" The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) likened fasting due upon a woman who died and left a debt, which must be paid because it is a right to human beings, whereas the vow is a right to Allah Almighty. So, the fulfillment of His right, Exalted be He, is more significant and proper than the fulfillment of the right of humans, for Allah is more worthy of fulfillment. It is narrated in some narrations by Al-Bukh\u0101ri and in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections that \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Whoever dies while some fast is due on him, his guardian should fast on his behalf.\" Wal\u012b (guardian): It refers to one's male relatives such as the fathers and sons. If the guardian does not observe the fast on his behalf, he should feed a poor person in return for each day of the fast. Thereby, the deceased person's duty is fulfilled, as the guardian's discharge of this duty is tantamount to his own discharge of it. This applies if the deceased person was able to fulfill the duty at its time or later but failed to do so. But if he dies before being able to make up for the missed fast - like the case of a person whose illness lingers until he dies - then there is nothing due on him, and his guardians are not required to fast or feed the poor on his behalf.\nIn the Had\u012bth: It is permissible to fast on behalf of the dead.\nAnd in it: It is permissible to fulfill vows on behalf of the dead.\nAnd in it: Giving parables and analogical comparisons to make the topic clearer and more profound to those who hear it.\nAnd in it: Showing kindness to one's parents by the fulfillment of their vows and debts.."}, {"number": 387, "hadith": "Buraydah reported:  While I was sitting with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), a woman came to him and said: \"I gave a maidservant to my mother in charity, and she  died.\" He said: \"Your reward became due, and the inheritance has returned her to you.\" She said: \"O Messenger of Allah, a month of fasting was due on her; shall I fast on her behalf?\" He said: \"Fast on her behalf.\" She said: \"She never performed Hajj; shall I perform Hajj on her behalf?\" He said: \"Perform Hajj on her behalf.\" [In a version]: Fast two months..", "commentary": "The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used to ask the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) for Fatwas on many of their acts of worship and dealings, and he would give them Fatwas and clarify the right aspects to them.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Buraydah ibn al-Husayb al-Aslami (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that as he was sitting with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) one day, a woman came to him and told him that she gave a maidservant - a female slave - as charity to her mother during her lifetime, and she transferred her to her ownership through this charity. Then, her mother died and left behind this maidservant as part of her overall wealth, and her sole inheritor was her daughter. So, does she have the right to take the maidservant back to her ownership through inheritance, or not? So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to her: \"Your reward became due,\" i.e., your reward is established with Allah by upholding the ties with your mother and giving charity to her, and the maidservant was brought back to you by the inheritance from your mother, a reason in which you have no part. So, this does not detract from the reward for charity, and it is not regarded as retracting the charity or gift, because this is not optional.\nThen, the questioner said that a month of fasting was due on her mother - and in a version: \"two months\" - and asked whether she could fast on her behalf. He did not point out whether this was the fasting of Ramadan, a vow, or an expiation. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to her: \"Fast on her behalf,\" i.e., make up for the days missed by your mother on her behalf, for this is a debt due upon her, and the debt of Allah is more worthy of being repaid. According to a version in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) likened the fasting due on a deceased person to a debt, which is payable, for this is a right to human beings; whereas the due fasting - be it related to Ramadan, a vow, or an expiation - is a right to Allah Almighty. So, the fulfillment of Allah's right is more significant and worthy than the fulfillment of the right of human beings; indeed, Allah is more entitled to repayment, as related in some versions by Al-Bukh\u0101ri. And in a Had\u012bth in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Whoever dies while some fast is still due on him, his heir should fast on his behalf.\" Heirs here refer to male relatives, such as fathers and sons. If the heir does not observe the missed fast on his behalf, he may feed one poor person in return for each day of a missed fast. Thus, this obligation ceases to be due on the deceased person. The observance of this missed fast by the heir is tantamount to the deceased person himself making up for this fast. This applies in case the deceased person was able to observe the fast or make up for it, yet he did not do that. As for someone who dies before being able to make up for the missed fast - like a person who remains ill until he dies - there is nothing due on him, and their heirs should not observe the missed fast, or feed poor people, on his behalf.\nThen, the woman informed him that her mother died while she had never performed Hajj. This seems to indicate that she was able to perform Hajj, and so it was due on her. This is because Hajj ceases to be due on anyone who is not able to perform it. But she did not perform Hajj. So, is it valid to perform Hajj on her behalf? The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to her: \"Perform Hajj on her behalf.\" Perhaps it can be understood from the Prophet's permission to her to perform Hajj on behalf of her mother that the woman had already performed Hajj for herself and then she wanted to perform Hajj on behalf of her mother, based on a Had\u012bth narrated by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd, in which Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) heard a man say: \"Labbayk on behalf of Shubrumah.\" He said: \"Who is Shubrumah?\" He said: \"A brother of mine,\" or \"a relative of mine.\" He said: \"Did you perform Hajj for yourself?\" He said: 'No.' Thereupon, he said: \"Perform Hajj for yourself and then perform Hajj on behalf of Shubrumah.\" And in the Sah\u012bh Collection of Ibn Khuzaymah: \"This is for you, and then perform Hajj on behalf of Shubrumah.\" If Hajj becomes due on someone and he dies before performing it, and then someone else performs Hajj on his behalf, he is absolved of this obligation. It is likely in light of the bounty and grace of Allah that if an heir performs Hajj on behalf of a deceased person, Allah will forgive the deceased person by virtue of that, give him a reward for it, or not punish him for his negligence.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that if a person gives something in charity and then inherits it, he has the right to take and dispose of it, without his reward diminishing because of that.\nIt points out that fasting can be observed on behalf of a deceased person.\nIt also demonstrates that Hajj can be performed on behalf of a deceased person.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that a person can show kindness to his parents by fulfilling their vows and debts.."}, {"number": 388, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"If one of you is invited for food while he is fasting, let him say: 'I am fasting.'\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was keen on maintaining good relations, harmony, and continuous cordiality among the Muslims. Hence, he made the acceptance of an invitation a due right among the Muslims, so that they stay connected and get together.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) says: \"If one of you is invited to food,\" i.e., any food, be it a banquet or something else, \"while he is fasting\" on a supererogatory basis, or making up for a missed fast, or in fulfillment of a vow, he should apologize. Specifically, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) directed the fasting person to clarify his condition: \"let him say: 'I am fasting'\" in an apology to the inviting person and to inform him that he is fasting and cannot eat from his food.\nThis is also meant to notify his fellow Muslim who invited him that his abstention is only because of fasting, not that he did not want to eat from his food. It was the habit of the Arabs that if they held evil intentions toward someone, they would not eat from his food. It is narrated in the Sah\u012bh Muslim Collection that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"If one of you is invited, let him answer the invitation. If he is fasting, let him supplicate (for the inviter); if he is not fasting, let him eat.\"\nIn the Had\u012bth: There is nothing wrong with revealing voluntary acts of worship - like prayer and fasting - if there is a need for that.."}, {"number": 389, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"Every action of the son of Adam is multiplied, and a single good deed is worth ten to seven hundred times. Allah Almighty said: 'Except for fasting, for indeed it is for Me, and I will give reward for it. He leaves his desires and food for My sake.' For the fasting person, there are two moments of joy: a moment of joy when he breaks his fast, and a moment of joy when he meets his lord. Verily, the Khul\u016bf (unpleasant smell) coming from his mouth is more fragrant with Allah than the smell of musk.\".", "commentary": "Fasting is one of the most beloved acts of worship to Allah and the most sublime acts of piety whereby a servant seeks closeness to his Almighty Lord. Thus, its reward is immense, and its merit is great. The honor afforded by Allah for the fasting people is ceaseless, for they deprive themselves of food, drink, and sexual relations, and so Allah Almighty gives them from His vast bounty and prefers them over others.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) mentions that the reward for every act of goodness, righteousness, and worship performed by a Muslim gets multiplied, with a good deed being rewarded tenfold, up to seven hundred fold. Allah Almighty says: {Whoever comes with a good deed will be rewarded tenfold.} [Surat al-An\u2018\u0101m: 160] Allah Almighty also says: {The likeness of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a grain that sprouts seven ears, each ear bearing a hundred grains. And Allah gives multiple [rewards] for whom He wills. And Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.} [Surat al-Baqarah: 261]\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) mentioned that Allah Almighty said: \"Except for fasting, for indeed it is for Me,\" i.e., fasting is excluded from these acts whose rewards are multiplied, for the reward of fasting can only be estimated by Allah Almighty. This is because fasting is a secret between a servant and his Lord. \"and I will give reward for it,\" i.e., Allah Almighty is the One Who undertakes this reward and recompense, for the reward of fasting can only be enumerated by Allah, Exalted be He. He did not leave that to His angels. Rather, He undertook the giving of reward for it by Himself, and when Allah undertakes something by Himself, this denotes the immensity of this reward and recompense. This is because the fasting person abandons what his soul desires and the pleasures of food, drink, and copulation which are made lawful by Allah Almighty, in obedience to Allah, Exalted be He, and in pursuit of His love and approval.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) stated that the fasting person has two moments of joy: The First Joy: \"a moment of joy when he breaks his fast;\" this joy occurs in the worldly life after he ends and breaks the fast and completes the worship, hoping for Allah's reward and bounty. The second joy occurs when he dies and obtains the reward and recompense.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) swears that \"the Khul\u016bf (unpleasant smell) coming from his mouth\" - the unusual foul smell that remains, after eating, in the mouth of a fasting person - \"is more fragrant,\" i.e., better to Allah than the smell of musk. There is a difference of opinion regarding the Khul\u016bf being more fragrant to Allah than the smell of musk. It means that it is more fragrant to Allah than the smell of musk to you; or it means that Allah Almighty will reward him in the Hereafter until his smell becomes more fragrant than the smell of musk; or that the person with the Khul\u016bf will obtain a reward better than the smell of musk; or that the Khul\u016bf is more rewardable than musk, which is recommended during Fridays and Eids; or that the angels find the Khul\u016bf more pleasant than the smell of musk.\nThe Had\u012bth points out the reward and merit of fasting.."}, {"number": 390, "hadith": "\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah, the Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her), reported:  One day the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to me: \"O \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah, do you have something (to eat)?\" I said: \"O Messenger of Allah, there is nothing with us.\" Thereupon, he said: \"Then, I am fasting.\" She said: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went out, and a gift was given to us - or some visitors came in. When the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came back, I said to him: \"O Messenger of Allah, a gift was given to us - or some visitors came in - but I have saved something for you.\" He said: \"What is it?\" I said: \"Hays.\" He said: \"Bring it.\" So, I brought it to him, and he ate. Then, he said: \"I woke up in the morning while fasting.\" Talhah said: I narrated this Had\u012bth to Muj\u0101hid and he said: \"This is like a man giving charity out of his wealth. He may spend it if he wills or withhold it if he wills.\".", "commentary": "This Had\u012bth reveals one aspect of the Prophet's guidance in intending to fast, if a person did not find food, and breaking the fast if he found food. This stems from the leniency, ease, and flexibility of Islam. \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah, the Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her), relates that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) one day asked her while being in her house in the morning, according to the version by An-Nas\u0101\u2019i: \"O \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah, do you have anything?\" He meant food for him to eat, as related in the wording by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd. She replied to him that she had no food. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), intending to fast, said: \"Then, I am fasting,\" i.e., I am observing fast and abstaining from food. This indicates the legitimacy of intending to observe supererogatory fasting during the daytime, in case one has not eaten or drunk anything since the Adh\u0101n of Fajr.\nThen, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah, the Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her), said that after the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went out in a state of fasting, a gift of food was given to them - the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would eat from gifted food, unlike food given as charity - or some visitor came to them and brought a gift of food.\nWhen the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came back to the house of \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah, the Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her), she told him about that and said that she hid part of the food for him to eat, as she knew he wanted to eat. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked her about the kind of food. She said: \"Hays\", which is a food made from a mixture of butter with dried dates. It is said: Flour or dried milk is added to it. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked her to bring it for him to eat therefrom. He (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ate from it after having the intention to fast. Therefore, he said after eating: \"I woke up in the morning fasting.\" This was supererogatory fasting. This is a teaching from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to the Muslims so that they can follow his example.\nTalhah ibn Yahya, who narrated the Had\u012bth from \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah bint Talhah, said: I narrated this Had\u012bth narrated by \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah bint Talhah to Muj\u0101hid ibn Jabr al-Makki, the erudite Im\u0101m, and he said: \"This is like a man giving charity out of his wealth. He may spend it if he wills or withhold it if he wills,\" i.e., the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did that because he had free choice regarding supererogatory fasting. This is like a man who intends to give charity from his wealth. If he wills, he can go ahead and give it to the one to whom he intended to give it, and if he wills, he can withhold it and not give it out.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) could break the supererogatory fasting at any time of the day.\nIt shows that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) possessed little of worldly things because he adopted an ascetic approach to the transient worldly pleasures and preferred the bliss of the Hereafter with Allah.\nIt also suggests that if a person allocates part of his wealth for charity and then reconsiders and decides not to give charity, there is nothing wrong with that.."}, {"number": 391, "hadith": "Mu\u2018\u0101dhah al-\u2018Adawiyyah reported: I asked \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah, the wife of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him):  \u201cDid the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to fast three days of each month?\" She said: 'Yes.' I said to her: \"Which days of the month did he use to fast?\" She said: \"It did not matter to him which days of the month he fasted.\".", "commentary": "People would ask the Prophet's wives about his custom regarding matters unclear to them or those they liked to learn about.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Mu\u2018\u0101dhah al-\u2018Adawiyyah informs that she asked \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah, the Mother of the Believers, (may Allah be pleased with her): \"Did the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) use to fast three days of each month?\" The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) urged the observance of fasting for three days every month, as narrated in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections. In response to her, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: 'Yes', he used to fast them, and this was the minimum he would fast in a month. Then, Mu\u2018\u0101dhah al-\u2018Adawiyyah asked for the specification of these days; whether they were at the start, middle, or end of the month, and whether they were successive or separated? \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) told her that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not care about fixing these days; rather, she would find him fasting at the start of the month and at its middle and at its end. It was said: He (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) probably did not observe three specific days in a persistent manner, lest it might be thought they were specified.\nIn a Had\u012bth narrated by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd, \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn Mas\u2018\u016bd (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to fast - meaning at the Ghurrah of each month - three days, i.e., the start of the month. The Ghurrah of something is its beginning. It was also said: He meant the white days in the middle of the month during which the moon becomes full, namely the 13th, 14th, and 15th days. This is because Ghurrah also refers to whiteness. So, the Companion \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn Mas\u2018\u016bd, who reported the Had\u012bth, probably mentioned the usual practice based on his knowledge of the Prophet's conditions and that he used to fast these days. Also, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), as narrated in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections, reported that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would fast so often outside Ramadan until it was said: He does not cease fasting. And he would refrain from fasting until it was said: He does not fast. Nonetheless, he used to fast on certain days, like the days at the start of the month and its middle, as well as on Mondays and Thursdays.\nThe bottom line is that there were numerous conditions for the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) regarding fasting. Every Companion reported what he knew about the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), or what he saw, or what was suitable in a certain situation; all the reports about the Prophet's fasting are authentic, which falls under permissibility and flexibility for those who want to fast as they wish while being keen to adhere to the Prophet's Sunnah and keep away from the days in which fasting is prohibited.\nIn the Had\u012bth: Demonstrating the practice of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) as he used to fast often and diligently."}, {"number": 392, "hadith": "Abu Qat\u0101dah al-Ans\u0101ri (may Allah be pleased with him) reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was asked about his fasting. He said: . The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) got angry. Thereupon, \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"We are pleased with Allah as a Lord, with Islam as a religion, with Muhammad as a Messenger, and with our pledge of allegiance as a pledge of allegiance.\" He said: He was asked about fasting of Ad-Dahr (all days), and he said: May he not fast or break his fast, or he has not fasted or broken his fast. He said: He was asked about fasting for two days and not fasting for one day, and he said: Who could bear that?! He said: He was asked about fasting one day and not fasting for two days, and he said: I wish that Allah had given us the strength for that. He said: He was asked about fasting one day and not fasting for one day, and he said: That is the fasting of my brother David (D\u0101w\u016bd) (peace be upon him). He said: He was asked about fasting on Monday, and he said: That is the day on which I was born and the day on which I was sent (as a Prophet), or the revelation was sent down to me on that day. He said: And he said: Fasting three days every month and from Ramadan to the next Ramadan is (equivalent to) the fasting of Ad-Dahr (all days). He said: He was asked about fasting on the day of \u2018Arafah, and he said: It expiates the past year and the coming one. He said: He was asked about fasting on the day of \u2018\u0100sh\u016br\u0101\u2019, and he said: It expiates the past year..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) liked that a Muslim should perform the deeds he can bear and do regularly. People used to ask about his guidance (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) regarding matters confusing and unclear to them, or about things they would like to know, so that they could follow his example and attain success.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Abu Qat\u0101dah al-Ans\u0101ri (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was asked about his fasting, meaning: the fasting of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). In the version by Ahmed, it is mentioned that the questioner was a Bedouin, an Arab living in the desert. He (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) got angry and the effect of anger became manifest on his face, due to this man's statement and question. He probably got angry because he disliked the question, as he would need to answer it and feared that his answer would lead to some evil, namely that the questioner might think it to be obligatory or too little, or he might restrict himself to it while his condition allowed for more than that. As for the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), he restricted himself to it due to his preoccupation with the interests and rights of Muslims, and the rights of his wives and guests and those who came to him, lest his example might be followed by anyone, and this would cause harm to some people. The questioner should have said: How much should I fast? Or: How should I fast? Thus, he would pose the question regarding himself, to which he would give him an answer based on his condition, as he gave answers to others on the basis of their respective conditions. Moreover, the Prophet's fasting did not follow one pattern. Rather, it would differ with the difference of conditions. He would sometimes fast often and at other times less often, and a situation like that makes it hard to answer the question.\nWhen \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) noticed the Prophet's anger, he - out of politeness and respect towards the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and as an apology and appeasement to him, and out of pity towards the questioner - said: \"We are pleased with Allah as a Lord, with Islam as a religion, with Muhammad as a Messenger,\" i.e., we are pleased with His planning and predestination for us, and we have taken Him as our God and Deity, apart from anyone else. And we are pleased with Islam as a religion, as we have chosen it from among all religions and entered it being content and submissive, and we did not seek a religion other than Islam. And we are pleased with Muhammad (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) as a Messenger. We are pleased with all he brought from Allah Almighty and accepted that with submission and delight, and we believed what he said, obeyed his commands, and shunned his prohibitions, and we loved, followed, and supported him.\n\"and with our pledge of allegiance as a pledge of allegiance,\" which refers to the pledge of allegiance over Hijrah and Jihad. This shows complete faith and submission to Allah and to His Messenger and religion.\nWhen the Prophet's anger subsided, \u2018Umar asked him - as related in another version by Muslim - in a more accurate and rational manner that was closer to the truth. He posed his question in a general way that would benefit all people. He asked him about fasting for all days, which is the fasting for all the days of the year consecutively, and about the state of he who observes such fasts, as to whether it is commendable or dispraised. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"May he not fast or break his fast;\" or he said: \"He has not fasted or broken his fast.\" The meaning: He does not struggle against the severity of hunger and thirst because he gets used to fasting and so it becomes easier for him, and he does not need the patience over the effort upon which the reward is conditional. Hence, he becomes like one who did not fast. And since he does not gain the comfort and pleasure felt by those who break their fast, it is as if he did not break his fast. It was said: This means supplication against him, by way of deterring him. It may also be an informative statement, meaning that it is as if this person did not break the fast because he ate nothing, and he did not observe the fast because his fast was not prescribed by the Lawgiver.\nThen, he asked him about a person fasting for two days and not fasting for one day. Thus, the days he fasts are double the days he does not fast, which makes this act of worship more common than the usual way of life. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Who could bear that?!\", i.e., who can do that being able to continue fasting while discharging his other duties of the day?! He seemed to have disliked it, for it mostly goes beyond people's capacity, and so it is not encouraged by an easy and tolerant religion. It was said: It indicates that the reason for prohibition is weakness, which means: If anyone can bear it, there is nothing wrong with that.\nThen, he asked him about a person fasting one day and not fasting for two days. Thus, the days he does not fast are double the days he fasts, and he continues to do that for all his life. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) replied to him, saying: I wish that Allah had given us the strength for that. He seemed to have approved of this type of fasting and hoped to observe it. It was said: That his wish pertains to others in his Ummah, for the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would bear it and more than that, and it is authentically reported that he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to observe continuous fasts. It was said: This means that because of his preoccupation with his wives, guests, activities, and people, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not observe this amount of fasting on a continuous basis. This is not because of his weakness to bear fasting, or his lack of patience over abstinence from eating for this period.\nThen, he asked him about a person who fasts one day and does not fast for one day, and who takes that as a habit. In response, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"That is the fasting of my brother David (D\u0101w\u016bd) (peace be upon him).\" This indirectly indicates that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) encouraged this fasting, for it is very moderate and it takes the two aspects of worship and habit into the best consideration, and it is one of the most beloved fasts to Allah Almighty, as related in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections. This is because it is not ongoing fasting nor ongoing abandonment of fasting.\nThen, he asked him about the reason behind fasting on Monday. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"That is the day on which I was born and a day on which I was commissioned (as a Prophet),\" i.e., the day of the beginning of my prophethood; so, it is the day most worthy of being fasted. Or he said: \"the revelation was sent down to me therein;\" the revelation began to come down on it.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said that fasting three days every month - which applies to specification, like the fasting of the white days: the 13th, 14th, and 15th days; or to generality, like fasting three days at the beginning of the month, its middle, or at its end, successively or sporadically - and the fasting of Ramadan every year is equivalent to the fasting of all days. That is, Allah, out of His grace and generosity, multiplies the reward for every act of goodness and worship, involving words or deeds, tenfold. So, a good deed is multiplied to ten similar good deeds. Likewise, the fasting of one day is recorded as fasting of ten days. Accordingly, if a person fasts three days, it is as if he fasts thirty days, which is a whole month. Thus, by fasting three days every month, it is as if he fasts the entire year, in addition to the obligatory fasting in the month of Ramadan.\nAnd he asked him about fasting on the day of \u2018Arafah. In response, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said that whoever fasts it, Allah forgives for him the sins of two years: the past year and the coming year. This fasting is to be observed by non-pilgrims, for it is disliked for a pilgrim to fast on the day of \u2018Arafah. This is because fasting on this day will make the pilgrim too weak to stand and supplicate. As for non-pilgrims, they are addressed by this Had\u012bth to the relevant merit and attainment of rewards from Allah Almighty. The day of \u2018Arafah is the ninth day of Dhul-Hijjah. It was called as such because it comprises one of the pillars of Hajj, namely standing at \u2018Arafah in Makkah.\nThen, he asked him about the fasting of the day of \u2018\u0100sh\u016br\u0101\u2019, which is the tenth day of the month of Muharram. This is the day in which Allah saved Moses (peace be upon him) and his people from Pharaoh. So, Moses fasted it in gratitude to Allah for His favor in destroying the oppressors. In response, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said that Allah forgives by fasting this day the sins of the past year.\nThis expiation includes minor sins, not the major ones. As for major sins, they can only be expiated by repentance or mercy from Allah, or it is hoped the major sins will be alleviated. It was said: The expiation for the coming year is that He will preserve him from committing sins in it. It was also said: that He will give him an amount of mercy and reward that expiates for the past year and the next one if it comes and he commits sins therein.\nThese questions by \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) point to his proper understanding. He first calmed the anger of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and then asked him about certain types of fasting that comprise all that a Muslim can observe, and he knew their rulings, while demonstrating which of them are valid and which are not and pointing out the merit of some of them. Meanwhile, he taught us all of that. So, whoever wishes can observe the valid fast and choose what is more suitable for himself and his ability.\nThe Had\u012bth points out the merit of fasting on Monday.\nIt also points out the merit of fasting on the day of \u2018\u0100sh\u016br\u0101\u2019.\nIt also shows the merit of fasting on the day of \u2018Arafah.\nAnd it demonstrates the merit of fasting during the month of Ramadan.\nThe Had\u012bth points out that Allah is Kind to His servants, and He facilitates things for them and removes hardships and restrictions from them.\nThe  Had\u012bth prohibits fasting for all days.\nAnd it forbids overburdening oneself in worship with things beyond one's capacity.."}, {"number": 393, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported in a Marf\u016b\u2018 Had\u012bth:  He [i.e., the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him)] was asked: \"Which prayer is the most excellent after the obligatory prayer? And which fasting is the most excellent after the month of Ramadan?\" He said: \"The most excellent prayer after the obligatory prayer is prayer in the middle of the night, and the most excellent fasting after the month of Ramadan is fasting Allah's month of Al-Muharram.\".", "commentary": "Prayer and fasting are among the pillars of Islam. Allah determined the obligatory prayer as five prayers during the day and night and determined the obligatory fasting as the fasting of the month of Ramadan. But, if anyone wants to perform these two forms of worship on a voluntary basis, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) specified its meritorious times during which the servant obtains the best reward.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was asked about the best times and conditions for offering prayer and observing fast voluntarily. So, someone asked him: What are the best prayers after performing the five obligatory prayers, which must be offered? These are the best forms of worship whereby a servant can seek closeness to Allah Almighty before thinking about supererogatory and additional worship, in case he wants to offer that voluntarily. In a clarifying and demonstrating reply, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"The most excellent prayer after the obligatory prayer is prayer in the middle of the night.\" This is because prayer during the night is more likely to be free from Riy\u0101\u2019 (show-off) and closer to sincerity, and the praying person can offer it in a focused and carefree manner away from daytime preoccupations. Plus, this is more helpful in remembering the Qur\u2019an and not forgetting some of the verses. The middle of the night means: the last third of the night.\nAnd he was asked about the most excellent fasting after the obligatory fasting of Ramadan, and he replied that the most excellent fasting after the month of Ramadan is fasting Allah's month of Al-Muharram, which is one of the sacred months within which Allah prohibited fighting. The month is attributed to Allah by way of extolment. It is the first month in the Hijri calendar, which is a reason for him to start it with the doing of good and receive it with worship. This is one of the best deeds, just as the first part of the day is received with Dhikr. So, it is hoped that this expiates for the rest of the year, akin to the merit of Dhikr in the early part of the day. It is also probable that since fighting was prohibited during Muharram, seizing its time for fasting was a good opportunity because the times during which fighting is permissible may entail that the believer does not fast, for fasting causes weakness.\nThe Had\u012bth points out the merit of prayer in the middle of the night.\nIt demonstrates the merit of fasting during the month of Muharram.\nIt also indicates that supererogatory and voluntary worship can be offered after performing the obligations.."}, {"number": 394, "hadith": "Abu Ayy\u016bb al-Ans\u0101ri (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"If anyone fasts Ramadan and then follows it with six days in Shaww\u0101l, it will be like a perpetual fast.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to fast some days every month on a voluntary basis, and he urged his Companions to do the same. He also urged the fasting of some days within the months of the year, given their abundant reward.\nIn this Had\u012bth, he directed the Muslims to fast six days in Shaww\u0101l, after Ramadan, and pointed out that if anyone fasts the entire Ramadan and then fasts six days in Shaww\u0101l, successive or sporadic - for fasting them successively or sporadically falls under the adherence to the Sunnah - he will obtain a reward equivalent to fasting the entire year. This stems from the great bounty of Allah towards His Muslim servants, as He multiplies the reward for them. This is explained by the verse that reads: {Whoever comes with a good deed will be rewarded tenfold.} [Surat al-An\u2018\u0101m: 160] The month of Ramadan is equivalent to ten months, and fasting six days after Eid al-Fitr completes the year.\nThe Had\u012bth points out the merit of fasting six days in the month of Shaww\u0101l.."}, {"number": 395, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"I was shown Laylat al-Qadr, and then some members of my family woke me up, and I was caused to forget it. So, seek it in the remaining ten days.\" [And in a version]: I forgot it..", "commentary": "Laylat al-Qadr is a great night whose status Allah points out in Surat al-Qadr. In this night the Qur\u2019an was revealed; worship in it is better than worship in a thousand months; the angels descend in it with the permission of Allah; and it contains safety, security, and peace. It is known to occur, but its time is unknown. Several versions are reported from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) regarding the specification of Laylat al-Qadr. This Had\u012bth is one of those versions, and in it the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"I was shown Laylat al-Qadr,\" i.e., I was made aware of the specification of Laylat al-Qadr and on which night it occurs, but \"some members of my family woke me up.\" This indicates that the Prophet's sighting of it was in a dream. However, his dreams (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and the dreams of the prophets (peace be upon them) were divine revelations. This does not denote that he did not learn about it during wakefulness. As the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was caused to forget it, he said: \"So, seek it in the remaining ten days,\" i.e., try to find it in the remaining ten days, which are the last ten days of the month of Ramadan as a whole. Other versions in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections state that it occurs on odd-numbered days within the last ten days of Ramadan. The Prophet's statement: \"seek it\" denotes encouragement to try to find it. This should be done by engaging in worship, supplication, and pious acts.\nThis Had\u012bth mentions that the reason behind the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forgetting Laylat al-Qadr was that some members of his household awakened him. And it is mentioned in a Had\u012bth in the Sah\u012bh Al-Bukh\u0101ri Collection, reported by \u2018Ub\u0101dah ibn as-S\u0101mit (may Allah be pleased with him), that the reason behind that was a dispute and conflict between two men. And also in a Had\u012bth in the Sah\u012bh Muslim Collection, reported by Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him), with the wording: \"There came two men contending with each other and along with them was the devil.\" To reconcile these two Had\u012bths, this may either be taken to denote plurality; thus, the vision in the Had\u012bth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) was a dream. The forgetfulness happened because of awakening, and the vision in the Had\u012bth reported by others happened during wakefulness, while the forgetfulness occurred because of the mentioned dispute. Or it may be taken to suggest the occurring of the two stories, in which case the forgetfulness happened twice for two reasons. Or this may probably mean: Some members of my family awakened me, and I heard the dispute between the two men and got up to mediate between them. So, I was caused to forget it, due to my preoccupation with the two men.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was subject to forgetfulness, in what Allah willed.\nIt points out that Laylat al-Qadr lies in the last ten days of Ramadan.\nIt urges us to seek Laylat al-Qadr.."}, {"number": 396, "hadith": "\u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2019Unays reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"I was shown Laylat al-Qadr and then I was caused to forget it. I saw myself prostrating in water and mud on its morning.\" He said: We had rain during the twenty-third night. So, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) led us in prayer and left, and indeed the trace of water and mud was on his forehead and nose. He said: \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2019Unays used to say: The twenty-third..", "commentary": "There is no doubt that the greatest month in the sight of Allah is the month of Ramadan, and the greatest night is Laylat al-Qadr. Therefore, the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) diligently tried to specify it. So, numerous Had\u012bths were reported on determining this night.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2019Unays (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"I was shown Laylat al-Qadr and then I was caused to forget it,\" i.e., I came to know on which day it occurs. Then, this knowledge was taken away from me. Jibr\u012bl (Gabriel) (peace be upon him) informed him of its specific time in that year. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) saw in a dream - and the dreams of the prophets are true and truth, and constitute revelation from Allah Almighty - that its sign is that he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was prostrating in water and mud. Then, \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2019Unays (may Allah be pleased with him) related that it rained on the twenty-third night. The Prophet's vision of himself prostrating in water and mud came true. He led them in Qiy\u0101m al-Layl and departed after the prayer as the trace of water and mud was on his forehead and nose due to prostrating over them. This was confirmation of the Prophet's dream. The roof of his mosque was made of palm leaf stalks. Based on this Had\u012bth, \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2019Unays (may Allah be pleased with him) used to determine Laylat al-Qadr to be the twenty-third night every year. Several Had\u012bths are reported specifying the time of Laylat al-Qadr. The scholars had a lot to say on reconciling these Had\u012bths or favoring some above others. This includes: that Laylat al-Qadr moves every year within the last ten days of Ramadan. It was called Laylat al-Qadr because of its high status and rank, or because the pious deeds performed therein are of great significance. Out of Allah's wisdom, He concealed it from people for them to diligently seek it within the nights, and thus, they will engage more in worship, which brings benefits to them.\nThe Had\u012bth mentions prostration on water and mud.\nIt states that the dreams of the prophets are true.\nIt urges us to seek Laylat al-Qadr and utilize it for the performance of righteous deeds, given the increased merit and reward therein.\nIt affirms prostration on the forehead and nose.."}, {"number": 397, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported:  We were talking about Laylat al-Qadr in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), who said: \"Who amongst you remembers when the moon rose and it was like a half of plate?\".", "commentary": "Laylat al-Qadr is a great night.

Several versions are reported from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) regarding the specification of Laylat al-Qadr or the nature of its night.\nThis Had\u012bth is one of those versions, and it identifies one of the characteristics of Laylat al-Qadr. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that they talked to one another about Laylat al-Qadr and its status and significance, the merit of performing Qiy\u0101m al-Layl therein, and its signs which were mentioned by the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Who amongst you remembers when the moon rose, and it was like a half of plate?\" He likened the moon to half of a food plate. The meaning: Who amongst you remembers the night in which half of the moon appeared like half of a food plate? This was the sign of Laylat al-Qadr in this month known to them and in that year, or the sign of Laylat al-Qadr in all years. This indicates that Laylat al-Qadr can be seen and verified by whomever Allah wills.."}, {"number": 398, "hadith": "\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would strive more in the last ten days than he would strive in other than them..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was most keen on attaining rewards, and he was good at utilizing the virtuous times, including the last ten days of Ramadan, which are the best nights of the year, and they contain Laylat al-Qadr (the Night of Decree), which is better than a thousand months.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Mother of the Believers \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) relates that when the last ten days of Ramadan came - starting from the night of the 21th day until the end of the month - the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would strive more in them than he would strive at other times, i.e., more than his diligence in other nights. This is due to the significance and merit of those nights and in pursuit of Laylat al-Qadr. He would engage more in righteous deeds and worship, draw close to Allah Almighty, retire in his praying place, and keep away from women. This is demonstrated by another version in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections: \"When the ten days came, he would pray all night, wake up his family, show diligence, and tie up his lower garment firmly.\"\nThe Had\u012bth demonstrates keenness to engage diligently in worship during the last ten days of Ramadan.\nIt indicates that one should strive to have the best possible ending of Ramadan.."}, {"number": 399, "hadith": "\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported:  I never saw the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) fasting during the ten days..", "commentary": "The month of Dhul-Hijjah is one of the sacred months. It includes the ten days at its beginning, during which righteous deeds are greatly meritorious. They include the day of \u2018Arafah, the ninth day. And they include the day of Eid al-Ad'ha, the tenth day. A number of Had\u012bths are reported on their merit.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Mother of the Believers \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reports that she did not see the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) fasting during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah. In another version narrated by Muslim, she said: \"He did not fast the ten days.\" The ten days here refer to the nine days from the beginning of Dhul-Hijjah, for fasting on the day of Eid is forbidden.\nThis Had\u012bth indicates that it is disliked fasting the ten days; whereas other Had\u012bths point to the merit of performing pious deeds - which include fasting - in those ten days. It is authentically narrated in the Sah\u012bh Al-Bukh\u0101ri Collection that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"There are no deeds on any day better than deeds in these,\" i.e., the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah. It is probable that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not observe fasting on these days because he would sometimes abandon certain deeds, though he would like to perform them, for fear that they might be ordained upon his Ummah. The merit of fasting the day of \u2018Arafah by non-pilgrims is mentioned in a Had\u012bth narrated by Muslim: \"Fasting the day of \u2018Arafah, I expect from Allah that it expiates the sins of the preceding year and the next one.\"."}, {"number": 400, "hadith": "\u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) reported:  I heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) proclaim Talbiyah with his hair matted, saying: \"Labbayka allahumma labbayk, labbayka la shar\u012bka laka labbayk, inna al-hamda wa an-ni\u2018mata laka wa al-mulk, la shar\u012bka lak.\" (Here I am at Your service, O Allah, here I am at Your service, here I am at Your service. You have no partner; the praise, the favor, and the dominion belong to You. You have no partner). He would not say anything more than these words. \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) used to say: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would offer two Rak\u2018ahs in Dhul-Hulayfah, and when his she-camel stood upright with him on its back near the mosque of Dhul-Hulayfah, he proclaimed Talbiyah with these words. \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) used to say: \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b (may Allah be pleased with him) used to proclaim Talbiyah like the Talbiyah of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) with these words and would say: Labbayka allahumma labbayk, labbayka wa sa\u2018dayk, wa al-khayr fi yadayk, labbayka wa ar-raghba\u2019 ilayka wa al-\u2018amal (Here I am at Your service, O Allah, here I am at Your service. Here I am at Your service, in bliss. Good is in Your Hands. Here I am at Your service; things are sought of You, and deeds are done for Your sake)..", "commentary": "This Had\u012bth demonstrates the manner of the Prophet's Talbiyah upon assuming Ihr\u0101m for Hajj. \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) mentions that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) \"proclaimed Talbiyah,\" i.e., he said Talbiyah in a loud voice, \"with his hair matted,\" i.e., he put something like glue in his hair to prevent it from drooping or to keep insects away. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to say in his Talbiyah: \"Labbayka allahumma labbayk\" (Here I am at Your service, O Allah, here I am at Your service), i.e., I repeat my response to You in complying with Your command to perform Hajj; so, I respond to Your command time and again. \"labbayka la shar\u012bka laka labbayk\" (Here I am at Your service; You have no partner), i.e., You alone are Sovereign in Your dominion, without any opponent or partner. \"inna al-hamda wa an-ni\u2018mata laka\" (the praise, the favor... belong to You), i.e., praise, gratitude, and laudation are due to You alone, and every favor comes from You, and You are the Giver of it. \"wa al-mulk, la shar\u012bka lak\" (and the dominion belongs to You; You have no partner). He mentioned the dominion after the praise and favor to generalize the causes of obedience and demonstrate the aspects of submission and worship. Then, he followed that with the words \"la shar\u012bka lak\" (You have no partner) to dispel any resemblance to Him and affirm that He alone is the Possessor of the dominion, the praise, and the favor. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would not say anything beyond these words in his Talbiyah and the assumption of Ihr\u0101m. It is said: The wisdom behind Talbiyah is to note Allah's honor to His servants as they come to His House after a call from Him.\nThen, \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) says that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) offered two Rak\u2018ahs in the mosque of Dhul-Hulayfah. This refers to the Zhuhr prayer performed in a shortened form, as related in a Had\u012bth narrated by Muslim and reported by Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s. Dhul-Hulayfah is a place lying outside Mad\u012bnah, on the way to Makkah. Dhul-Hulayfah is located 6 or 7 miles, nearly 9 or 10km, away from Mad\u012bnah. It is the Miq\u0101t of the people of Mad\u012bnah and the non-residents who pass by it. It is known today among the ordinary people as Abiy\u0101r \u2018Ali or \u0100b\u0101r \u2018Ali. It lies about 420km away from Makkah. On the day he arrived in Dhul-Hulayfah, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) performed the \u2018Asr prayer therein as two Rak\u2018ahs. Then, he performed the Maghrib, \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019, Fajr, and Zhuhr prayers there. Thus, he offered five prayers there and stayed for a day and night. \"and when his she-camel stood upright with him on its back near the mosque of Dhul-Hulayfah,\" i.e., he rode his she-camel, and it stood up in preparation for moving, \"he proclaimed Talbiyah with these words,\" i.e., the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) raised his voice as he said this supplication mentioned earlier.\nThen, \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b (may Allah be pleased with him) would assume Ihr\u0101m and raise his voice as the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to do and say: \"Labbayka allahumma labbayk, labbayka wa sa\u2018dayk\" (Here I am at Your service, O Allah, here I am at Your service. Here I am at Your service, in bliss), i.e., bliss after bliss, and I repeat that time and time again. \"Wa al-Khayr fi yadayk\" (Good is in Your Hands); good comes from You alone. \"Labbayka wa ar-raghba\u2019 ilayka wa al-\u2018amal.\" (Here I am at Your service; things are sought from You, and deeds are done for Your sake), i.e., things are sought from You and asked of You.\nThis addition was from the words of \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). Other additions to Talbiyah are reported from some of the Companions, who added them by way of increasing what is good.

Enough, enough.\" They would say: \"illa sharika howa lak; tamlikuhu wa ma malak\" (Except a partner with You, whom You possess and all what he possesses.\" They would say that while performing Taw\u0101f around the House!.", "commentary": "Talbiyah for Hajj among the Muslims involves proclamation of the Tawh\u012bd of Allah, sincere devotion to Him, and keeping away from Shirk.

Since the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) knew what they would add after that, he would say to them when they pronounced Talbiyah with Tawh\u012bd: \"Woe to you!\" i.e., you will be in ruin and destruction for what you add to the Talbiyah. \"Enough, enough!\" i.e., your statement of Tawh\u012bd is sufficient. Limit your Talbiyah to it and do not add the subsequent words: \"illa sharika howa lak; tamlikuhu wa ma malak\" (Except a partner with You, whom You possess and all what he possesses.\" By the partner, they meant their idols. This phrase in Arabic (tamlikuhu wa ma malak) has two potential meanings: First: You possess him and what is in his possession. Second: You possess him and he possesses nothing. They acknowledge that he is not worthy of any worship, for he is capable of nothing for himself or others, and that indeed the Sovereign is Allah. Nonetheless, they associate him with Allah in worship, out of ignorance or stubbornness, transgression, and arrogance! Allah Almighty says: {They have taken besides Him other gods who can create nothing but are themselves created. Nor do they have the power to harm or benefit themselves, nor do they have the power to cause death, give life or resurrect the dead.} [Surat al-Furq\u0101n: 3]\nMoreover, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) says that they used to say that while performing Taw\u0101f around the Sacred House of Allah by way of seeking closeness to Allah Almighty through false words, which are rejected.."}, {"number": 402, "hadith": "S\u0101lim reported:  When Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was told that Ihr\u0101m should start from Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019, he would say: Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019 about which you tell a lie about the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him)! The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not proclaim Talbiyah except at the tree when his camel stood up with him on its back..", "commentary": "The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) learned the rituals of Hajj from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) during the Farewell Hajj, as he enjoined them to do, and they passed them on to those who came after them.\nIn this Had\u012bth, S\u0101lim ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Umar mentions that when his father \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) was told that raising one's voice with Talbiyah in Hajj or \u2018Umrah should start from Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019, he would deny that and say: \"Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019 about which you tell a lie about the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him)!\" i.e., you allege that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) started his Talbiyah in his Hajj when he reached Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019. You are mistaken in this. He attributed lying to them, for they said something contrary to reality. This does not mean intentional lying. Indeed, the Arabs tend to say to one who made an error: You lied. Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019 is a place near Dhul-Hulayfah from the direction of Makkah. It was called Bayd\u0101\u2019 for the absence of landmarks therein such as buildings and the like. What is meant here is the elevated and high place opposite Dhul-Hulayfah from the direction of Makkah.\nThen, Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) explained what is right to them, namely that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not raise his voice with Talbiyah \"except at the tree\" located near the mosque of Dhul-Hulayfah, which is a village situated 6 or 7 miles (nearly 10km) away from Mad\u012bnah, and it is the Miq\u0101t for the people of Mad\u012bnah and the non-residents who pass by it. This happened when he set out for the Farewell Hajj. He raised his voice with Talbiyah as he rode his camel and made it stand up to leave, after he had assumed Ihr\u0101m at that location.\nThe difference between the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) over the places from which the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) proclaimed Talbiyah is probably caused by the fact that each of them talked about what he saw. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) left Mad\u012bnah for Hajj. When he prayed in the mosque of Dhul-Hulayfah, he proclaimed Talbiyah for Hajj, which some people heard and memorized from him. Then, he rode his she-camel, and it stood up, he proclaimed the Talbiyah, of which some people became aware, for they were coming in groups. So, they heard him and said: Indeed, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) proclaimed the Talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back. Then, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) proceeded, and when he ascended the elevated place of Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019, he proclaimed the Talbiyah, which some people became cognizant of and said: Indeed, he proclaimed the Talbiyah when he ascended the elevated place of Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019. So, each of them transmitted what he had heard. This shows that the difference arose over the starting of the Talbiyah and the assumption of Ihr\u0101m from the Miq\u0101t. This confusion is cleared up by a Had\u012bth narrated by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd, in which Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"By Allah, he proclaimed the Talbiyah in his place of prayer, proclaimed the Talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back, and proclaimed the Talbiyah when he ascended the elevated place of Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019.\"."}, {"number": 403, "hadith": "Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) reported  that Zayd ibn Arqam came, and \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s said to him, reminding him: \"How did you tell me about the meat of the game presented as a gift to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) while he was in a state of Ihr\u0101m?\" He said that he said: \"He was presented with a slice of the meat of the game, and he refused it, saying: \"Indeed, we will not eat it; we are in a state of Ihr\u0101m.\".", "commentary": "Hajj is one of the pillars of Islam, and it is an act of worship for those who can find a way to it.

In other words, did the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) accept it and eat therefrom or refuse it? So, Zayd ibn Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him) told him that when the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was presented with some meat and he knew that it was part of a hunted land animal, he refused the gift and did not accept it from the person who offered it to him. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) clarified to the man who presented the gift that he refused it because he was in a state of Ihr\u0101m, and a Muhrim may not eat from hunted land animals.\nIn a Had\u012bth in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections, Abu Qat\u0101dah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ate from his game while being in a state of Ihr\u0101m. However, Abu Qat\u0101dah was not in a state of Ihr\u0101m when he hunted this animal from which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ate. Reconciling the two Had\u012bths, the scholars said that he refused the first gift because the man hunted it for his sake, whereas he deemed the second game lawful because no role was played by a Muhrim in its hunt, and he did not hunt it for his sake. So, if a non-Muhrim hunts an animal for himself and then presents part of it to a Muhrim, there is nothing wrong with that, and the Muhrim may eat from it.\nThe Had\u012bth demonstrates the Prophet's guidance upon refusing a gift, and that he would mention the reason for refusing it. This stems from his good manners (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).."}, {"number": 404, "hadith": "Mu\u2018\u0101dh ibn \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n ibn \u2018Uthm\u0101n at-Taymi reported:  We were with Talhah ibn \u2018Ubaydull\u0101h as we were in a state of Ihr\u0101m.

Meanwhile, a grilled or cooked bird was gifted to Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him), and it probably was a hunted bird. Talhah was reclining, asleep. So, he did not know about the bird gifted to him, and the ruling on eating therefrom was not clear to those in the state of Ihr\u0101m. Therefore, the people fell under two categories; some of them ate from this bird, and others feared and refrained from eating from the gifted bird thinking that a Muhrim may not eat from it. \"When Talhah woke up, he agreed with those who ate it,\" i.e., he described their action as right, by words or deeds. Clarifying the reason behind his approval of those who ate, Talhah said: We ate the like of that along with the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) while we were in a state of Ihr\u0101m. So, eat from what was gifted to me.\nIn the Two Sah\u012bh Collections, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s reported: As-Sa\u2018b ibn Jathth\u0101mah al-Laythi presented to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) the meat of a zebra while he was in Al-Abw\u0101\u2019 or Wadd\u0101n (they are two places). The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) declined to eat therefrom. Upon noticing the unpleasant feeling on his face, he said to him: \"Indeed, we only declined it because we are in a state of Ihr\u0101m.\"\nReconciling between the two Had\u012bths, it is to be said that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) permitted the bird for them because the Muhrims played no role in hunting it. This is also explicitly mentioned in a Had\u012bth in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections, in which Abu Qat\u0101dah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that he hunted a zebra, and when they asked the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), he said to them: \"Did anyone of you command him or point to him with something?\" They said: 'No.' So, he said: \"Then, eat what is remaining of its meat.\"\nAs for declining the meat of the hunted animal from As-Sa\u2018b ibn Jathth\u0101mah, this is because he hunted it for the Prophet's sake, and he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was in a state of Ihr\u0101m, and a Muhrim may not eat from the meat of a prey which was hunted for him. Had he not been in a state of Ihr\u0101m, he would have accepted it and eaten it.\nThe Had\u012bth shows how the Companions used to explain the rulings of the religion to the contemporary T\u0101bi\u2018is.."}, {"number": 405, "hadith": "Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) got himself cupped and paid the cupper his wage, and he put medicine in his nose..", "commentary": "Allah Almighty has made good things lawful for His slaves and made unlawful for them anything evil and impure concerning food, drink, gains, trade, etc. The Shariah has also urged Muslims to have self-esteem and to elevate themselves from lowly things.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) mentions that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) \"got himself cupped,\" i.e., he asked someone to cup him. Cupping is to extract some blood from the body by pricking the area of pain and then absorbing and extracting this blood after collecting it by means of a cup, which is an instrument resembling a funnel. Cupping provides treatment for a variety of pains. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) paid the person who cupped him his wage for that. This is part of the Prophet's actual acts of Sunnah. If it was prohibited to give a wage to a cupper, he would not pay this cupper a wage. The scholars took the Had\u012bths prohibiting the earning by a cupper and stating that it is impure to denote purification and exaltation above lowly earnings and to urge noble manners and lofty matters. Or perhaps the prohibition was in the early days of Islam, and it was subsequently abolished. So, when he paid the cupper his wage, he abrogated the previous ruling.\nThen, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) mentioned another medicine which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used, saying: \"and he put medicine in his nose.\" To use it, a person lies down and places something below his shoulders to raise them, and then he puts drops of the medicine into his nose, so that they can reach his brain. Then, the illness comes out with sneezing.\nThe Had\u012bth demonstrates the Prophet's use of medicine and his pursuit of the proper means of treatment.\nIt mentions that the cupper took a wage for cupping.."}, {"number": 406, "hadith": "Nubayh ibn Wahb reported:  We went out with Ab\u0101n ibn \u2018Uthm\u0101n.

Aloes: A dry extract of a bitter tree. The intended meaning is that he should mix aloes with water and place drops from it into his eyes, or apply it to his eyes like kohl, or put it on his eyes. Aloe is not perfume, so it is not forbidden for a Muhrim.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that a Muhrim can bind the eyes and other areas with aloes.."}, {"number": 407, "hadith": "\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported:  Asm\u0101\u2019 bint \u2018Umays gave birth to Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr at the tree.

It is an act of worship for those who can find a way to it. Hajj involves hardship that entails facilitation. An example is that if a Muhrim woman gives birth during her state of Ihr\u0101m and before embarking upon the rituals of Hajj, she may take a bath, purify herself, and assume Ihr\u0101m for Hajj. She, however, may not perform Taw\u0101f except after her complete purification. This represents facilitation for her, so that she will not miss Hajj on its specific days. The Mother of the Believers \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) relates that Asm\u0101\u2019 bint \u2018Umays gave birth.

Asm\u0101\u2019 bint \u2018Umays was the wife of Abu Bakr as-Sidd\u012bq (may Allah be pleased with both of them).

This bath is meant for cleanliness, not purification, for a newly-delivered woman is like a menstruating woman: she does not become pure unless the blood stops flowing.\nA woman in a menstrual or postpartum period can validly perform all the rituals of Hajj except for Taw\u0101f, as indicated by a Had\u012bth narrated by An-Nas\u0101\u2019i and Ibn M\u0101jah, in which Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"and she should do what people do,\" of Dhikr and Talbiyah, and stand at Mina, \u2018Araf\u0101t, and Muzdalifah, \"except that she should not perform Taw\u0101f around the House,\" i.e., she should not perform Taw\u0101f Ar-Rukn around the honorable Ka\u2018bah unless she becomes pure of the postpartum bleeding, after which she can do Taw\u0101f.\nHis statement \"at the tree\" refers to the tree underneath which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to stop when he left Mad\u012bnah for Makkah to perform \u2018Umrah or Hajj. He would alight in the shade of this tree, pray, and then assume Ihr\u0101m for \u2018Umrah or Hajj.

A performer of Ifr\u0101d Hajj continues in his Ihr\u0101m until he throws [stones] at the Jamrat al-\u2018Aqabah, after which he shaves his head, performs Taw\u0101f around the House, and performs Sa\u2018i, if he has not performed Sa\u2018i along with Taw\u0101f al-Qud\u016bm (arrival), and he is not required to slaughter a Hady.

So, we had intercourse with our wives, put on perfume, and wore our garments, with only four nights separating us from \u2018Arafah. Then, we assumed the Ihr\u0101m on the day of Tarwiyah. Then, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) entered the place of \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) and found her weeping. He said: \"What is the matter with you?\" She said: \"I have got my menses, and the people ended their Ihr\u0101m, but I did not end it, nor did I perform Taw\u0101f around the House, and the people are going for Hajj now.\" He said: \"This is something that Allah decreed for the daughters of Adam. Take a bath and then assume Ihr\u0101m for Hajj.\" She did so and performed all the rituals. Then, when she became pure, she performed Taw\u0101f around the Ka\u2018bah and the rituals between Safa and Marwah. Then, he said: \"You have ended Ihr\u0101m from your Hajj and \u2018Umrah at the same time.\" She said: \"O Messenger of Allah, I feel upset because I did not make Taw\u0101f around the House until I performed Hajj.\" He said: \"Take her, O \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n, and make her perform \u2018Umrah from At-Tan\u2018\u012bm.\" That was on the night of Al-Hasbah..", "commentary": "Hajj is one of the pillars of Islam which Allah Almighty ordained upon His servants. It must be performed by those who are physically and financially capable. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) performed Hajj once, in the tenth Hijri year, and it was called the Farewell Hajj. So, the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) conveyed the details of this Hajj from him, in order for us to learn the manner of Hajj enjoined by Allah, Exalted be He.\nIn this Had\u012bth, J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that they - i.e., most of them - came with the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ready for the Hajj of Ifr\u0101d. Ihl\u0101l: raising one's voice with Talbiyah. It here means intending to assume Ihr\u0101m. Ifr\u0101d means that the pilgrim assumes Ihr\u0101m for Hajj only. \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah, Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her), was among those who assumed Ihr\u0101m for \u2018Umrah. When they were in 'Sarif', the name of a place ten miles (nearly 16km) away from Makkah, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) got her menses. When they arrived in Makkah, they performed Taw\u0101f around the Ka\u2018bah, and then performed Sa\u2018i between Safa and Marwah, which are the rituals of \u2018Umrah. Then, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) enjoined his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) who did not bring a Hady - anything offered to the Ka\u2018bah from livestock, camels, cows, and sheep as an act of worship to Allah - to end their Ihr\u0101m. They asked: To what extent should we end our Ihr\u0101m? They were hesitant regarding that because they came for Hajj, and a performer of Hajj should not end his Ihr\u0101m until he has completed all the rituals. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) answered them: 'Completely' i.e., all things forbidden due to Ihr\u0101m are now permissible. This state is called Tamattu\u2018 in Hajj. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and some of his Companions were among those who brought the Hady with them. So, they did not end their Ihr\u0101m. Those who did not bring the Hady obeyed the Prophet's command by taking off their clothing of Ihr\u0101m and then they cut their hair - they did not shave it so that they could do so after Hajj - and engaged in sexual intercourse with their women, applied perfume, and wore the clothes forbidden under Ihr\u0101m. At that point, only four nights separated them from standing at \u2018Arafah, on the ninth day of Dhul-Hijjah. Then, those who performed \u2018Umrah in Tamattu\u2018 Hajj assumed Ihr\u0101m for Hajj on the day of Tarwiyah, the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah. It was called as such because the water was little in Mina; so, they would quench their thirst with water and would carry it for later use.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) entered the place of \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) and found her weeping. He asked her why she wept, and she told him about her menses and that it prevented her from performing \u2018Umrah, as she did not perform Taw\u0101f around the Ka\u2018bah, and that she was still in her menstruation while the people were preparing for the rituals of Hajj. So, she was weeping over missing all of that. Comforting her, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"This\" i.e., the menses, is something that Allah Almighty decreed for the daughters of Adam. So, take a bath for cleansing and then assume Ihr\u0101m for Hajj, i.e., be in the Ihr\u0101m you have assumed. A woman in menstruation or postpartum period may perform all the rituals of Hajj except for Taw\u0101f, as per the Prophet's statement: \"So, do all what the pilgrims do, but do not perform Taw\u0101f.\" Narrated by Al-Bukh\u0101ri and Muslim.\n\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) did what the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) enjoined her to do. She performed all the rituals, standing at \u2018Arafah and going to Muzdalifah and Mina. Then, when she became pure from her menses, she performed Taw\u0101f around the Ka\u2018bah, and performed Sa\u2018i between Safa and Marwah. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informed her that she ended Ihr\u0101m from both her Hajj and \u2018Umrah, and this is because the rituals of \u2018Umrah were incorporated into Hajj, as she became a performer of Qir\u0101n Hajj. Therefore, she ended Ihr\u0101m from both at the same time. Thereupon, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah said to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): \"I feel upset because I did not make Taw\u0101f around the House until I performed Hajj,\" i.e., when she assumed Ihr\u0101m for \u2018Umrah in the beginning. She used the word Hajj and meant \u2018Umrah. The intended meaning is that she did not perform the \u2018Umrah of Tamattu\u2018 like others. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked her brother \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n ibn Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) to take her to At-Tan\u2018\u012bm so that she could assume Ihr\u0101m for \u2018Umrah from there - comforting her heart. At-Tan\u2018\u012bm is a place situated from 5 to 6 kilometers away from Makkah, and it is the closest area of Al-Hill (outside of the sacred precinct) to the House. It was called as such because Mount Nu\u2018aym lies to its right side and Mount N\u0101\u2018im lies to its left, and the valley is called Na\u2018m\u0101n. All that happened during the night of Al-Hasbah, i.e., the night of stay in Al-Muhassab after departing from Mina. Al-Muhassab is a place outside Makkah, and it is a broad channel area that contains tiny pebbles. It lies between Mina and Makkah and is closer to Mina. It is said: It is the place of throwing the pebbles in Mina. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) alighted there after the days of throwing the pebbles, where his freed slave Abu R\u0101fi\u2018 had set up the tent for him. The stopping and staying in this place happened before the farewell Taw\u0101f. It is narrated in the Sah\u012bh Al-Bukh\u0101ri Collection \"that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) performed the Zhuhr, \u2018Asr, Maghrib, and \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayers and then had a sleep in Al-Muhassab, after which he rode toward the House and performed Taw\u0101f around it.\"\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that if a performer of \u2018Umrah is a resident of Makkah or coming from outside Makkah and lies within the Miq\u0101t, his Miq\u0101t is from Al-Hill, and if he lies outside the Miq\u0101t, then his Miq\u0101t is the Miq\u0101t of his Hajj.\nIt also mentions that Hajj may be dissolved and turned into \u2018Umrah.\nThe Had\u012bth demonstrates that one Taw\u0101f and one Sa\u2018i are sufficient for both the Hajj and \u2018Umrah of a performer of Qir\u0101n Hajj.."}, {"number": 410, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) reported:  When we ended Ihr\u0101m, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanded us to assume Ihr\u0101m as we headed to Mina. He said: We pronounced Talbiyah in Al-Abtah..", "commentary": "The Prophet's Hajj abounded with rulings. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) demonstrated the rulings related to Hajj and \u2018Umrah and what should be done by a performer of Qir\u0101n, Tamattu\u2018, or Ifr\u0101d Hajj, as well as other rituals and rites that he ordered his Ummah to learn from him.\nIn this Had\u012bth, J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) reports that during the Farewell Hajj, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ordered them, after they ended their Ihr\u0101m following the performance of \u2018Umrah, to assume Ihr\u0101m for Hajj. Earlier, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had ordered some of his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) to end their Hajj and turn it into \u2018Umrah, addressing this command to those who had not brought the sacrificial animals with them. This was known as Tamattu\u2018 Hajj. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ordered them to assume Ihr\u0101m for Hajj as they headed to Mina on the 8th day of Dhul-Hijjah, the day of Tarwiyah. He said: \"We pronounced the Talbiyah,\" which is to raise one's voice in saying the Talbiyah and to have the intention of Ihr\u0101m for Hajj \"in Al-Abtah\", which is the Bat'h\u0101\u2019 of Makkah, a place full of pebbles and sand. It is also known as Al-Bat'h\u0101\u2019. This is a place located between Mina and Makkah, and it is closer to Mina. It is said: It is the place for throwing the Jamar\u0101t in Mina. It used to be called Khayf Bani Kin\u0101nah, and it lies outside Makkah, in the direction of Mad\u012bnah. They assumed Ihr\u0101m in Al-Abtah because they had alighted there. Indeed, if anyone wants to assume Ihr\u0101m for Hajj while he is in Makkah, he should assume it from the place where he stays or alights.\nThe Had\u012bth mentions Tamattu\u2018 Hajj, as \u2018Umrah is performed first.\nIt indicates that Ihr\u0101m for Hajj should be assumed on the day of Tarwiyah, which is the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah.."}, {"number": 411, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) reported:  Neither the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) nor his Companions performed Taw\u0101f between Safa and Marwah except for one Taw\u0101f. [Another version adds]: his first Taw\u0101f.", "commentary": "Hajj is one of the pillars of Islam, and it is an act of worship for those who can find a way to do it. Ihr\u0101m for it can either be assumed as Ifr\u0101d, Qir\u0101n, or Tamattu\u2018, which is performing \u2018Umrah before Hajj. This Had\u012bth clarifies one of the aspects of the Prophet's performance of Hajj in the Farewell Hajj. He performed Qir\u0101n Hajj, combining Hajj and \u2018Umrah, because he had the sacrificial animals with him. Therefore, J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"Neither the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) nor his Companions performed Taw\u0101f between Safa and Marwah except for one Taw\u0101f.\" Another version adds: \"his first Taw\u0101f,\" i.e., the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and those with him who performed Qir\u0101n Hajj did not engage in Sa\u2018i between Safa and Marwah except for one Sa\u2018i, which is the Sa\u2018i performed along with Taw\u0101f al-Qud\u016bm (Arrival). Indeed, one Taw\u0101f and one Sa\u2018i are sufficient for the performer of Qir\u0101n Hajj, in which the rituals of \u2018Umrah are included in the rituals of Hajj.\nAs for those who perform Tamattu\u2018 Hajj, doing \u2018Umrah before Hajj, they are required to perform two Sa\u2018is: one Sa\u2018i for their \u2018Umrah and one Sa\u2018i for their Hajj on the Day of Nahr (Slaughter). This is clarified by a Had\u012bth narrated by Al-Bukh\u0101ri and Muslim, and the wording here is of Al-Bukh\u0101ri, in which \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported: \"Those who raised their voices in Talbiyah for \u2018Umrah performed Taw\u0101f around the House and between Safa and Marwah. Then, they ended Ihr\u0101m, and then they performed another Taw\u0101f after returning from Mina,\" i.e., those who performed Tamattu\u2018 Hajj. \"As for those who combined Hajj and \u2018Umrah,\" i.e., who performed Qir\u0101n Hajj, \"they performed one Taw\u0101f.\"."}, {"number": 412, "hadith": "Abu Nadrah reported:  Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s used to enjoin Mut\u2018ah, whereas Ibn az-Zubayr used to prohibit it. He said: I mentioned that to J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h, who said: \"This Had\u012bth happened in my presence. We performed Tamattu\u2018 with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). When \u2018Umar rose up, he said: 'Indeed, Allah made permissible for His Messenger what He willed through what He willed, and indeed the Qur\u2019an was already revealed. So, {Complete Hajj and \u2018Umrah for Allah} [Surat al-Baqarah: 196] as Allah commanded you and cut off the marriage to these women. No man who married a woman for an appointed duration will be brought to me except that I will stone him.'\" [And in a version]: Separate your Hajj from your \u2018Umrah, for this makes your Hajj more complete and your \u2018Umrah more complete..", "commentary": "Mut\u2018ah in the Shariah is a term that jointly refers to the performance of \u2018Umrah in Mut\u2018ah until the coming of Hajj and to the Mut\u2018ah marriage. The right meaning is to be understood from the context where it occurs. There was a difference of opinion among the Prophet's Companions over the Mut\u2018ah marriage, with some deeming it permissible and others forbidding it, according to what each side understood from the Prophet's Sunnah. Likewise, there was a difference of opinion over Tamattu\u2018 of \u2018Umrah until the advent of Hajj.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Abu Nadrah Al-Mundhir ibn M\u0101lik al-Basri relates that \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) used to enjoin Mut\u2018ah, whereas \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with him) used to prohibit it. The difference arose over the interpretation of the meaning of Mut\u2018ah here: whether it is the Mut\u2018ah of Hajj or the Mut\u2018ah marriage. In a version by Muslim: \"Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s and Ibn az-Zubayr differed over the two kinds of Mut\u2018ah.\" The Mut\u2018ah marriage is to marry a woman for a specified period, using the word Tamattu\u2018, in return for a sum of money. This kind of marriage was permissible at the beginning. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade it since the day of the Battle of Khaybar until the Day of Judgment. Tamattu\u2018 in Hajj is when the pilgrim assumes Ihr\u0101m for \u2018Umrah during the months of Hajj and then ends his Ihr\u0101m, after which he assumes Ihr\u0101m for Hajj in the same year. So, if he comes to Makkah during the months of Hajj and performs \u2018Umrah and completes it, he may end his Ihr\u0101m and enjoy all that is lawful until the rituals of Hajj begin.\nSo, Abu Nadrah mentioned that difference of opinion to J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: \"This Had\u012bth happened in my presence\" i.e., I was present while it happened. He (may Allah be pleased with him) pointed out that they observed Tamattu\u2018 during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). J\u0101bir's response comprises the Mut\u2018ah of Hajj and the Mut\u2018ah marriage. \"When \u2018Umar rose up,\" i.e., assuming the caliphate, he said: \"Indeed, Allah made permissible for His Messenger what He willed\" of rulings \"through what He willed\" of the revelation which He willed to send down - the Qur\u2019an's verses and the Prophet's Had\u012bths. He thus indicated that such Mut\u2018ah marriages were exclusively permissible for them. \"and indeed the Qur\u2019an was already revealed,\" i.e., it was sent down and placed in order, its injunctions were completed and established, and its rulings settled; so, it is not subject to abrogation or alteration after the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) passed away; and it contains the command to complete Hajj and \u2018Umrah. Allah Almighty says: {And Complete Hajj and \u2018Umrah for Allah.} [Surat al-Baqarah: 196] By this, he meant that the Mut\u2018ah of Hajj was abolished when Allah commanded that Hajj and \u2018Umrah be completed; and likewise, the Mut\u2018ah marriage was abolished when Allah mentioned the conditions of marriage in His Book and clarified its rulings; so, nothing can be added thereto, omitted therefrom, or changed. \"So, complete Hajj and \u2018Umrah for Allah, as Allah commanded you.\" \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) held that the completion of Hajj and \u2018Umrah can be achieved by performing each of them separately. So, \u2018Umar's statement apparently indicates that it is invalid to dissolve Hajj and turn it into \u2018Umrah. He did not mean by this to contradict the Qur\u2019an and the Sunnah. Muslim narrated: \"that Abu M\u016bsa asked \u2018Umar about that, and \u2018Umar said: Indeed, I am aware that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his Companions engaged in it, but I disliked that the married persons should have intercourse with them under the shade of trees and then set out for Hajj with water trickling down of their heads.\" The meaning: I disliked Tamattu\u2018, for it entails exit from Ihr\u0101m and engaging in sexual intercourse with women until the departure for Hajj. It is authentically narrated in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections that Sur\u0101qah ibn M\u0101lik asked the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) when he ordered his Companions to dissolve Hajj and turn it into \u2018Umrah and observe Tamattu\u2018 until Hajj, saying: Does this apply to this year of ours or forever? Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: But forever.\n\u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said on the Mut\u2018ah marriage: \"and cut off,\" i.e., halt and finish this matter, namely marrying these women, i.e., the Mut\u2018ah. \"No man who married a woman for an appointed duration will be brought to me except that I will stone him.\" So, he considered the Mut\u2018ah marriage to be like adultery. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) permitted the Mut\u2018ah marriage in the beginning and then forbade it later during the Battle of Khaybar and until the Day of Judgment, and he declared it unlawful during the Farewell Hajj, as narrated by Al-Bukh\u0101ri, Muslim, and others.\nThe Had\u012bth warns against doing anything prohibited by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\nIt forbids the Mut\u2018ah marriage.."}, {"number": 413, "hadith": "Muhammad ibn \u2018Ali ibn al-Husayn reported:  We entered the place of J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h, he asked about the people, and when my turn came, I said: \"I am Muhammad ibn \u2018Ali ibn Husayn.\" He patted my head with his hand and undid my upper button and then undid my lower button. He then placed his hand between my nipples, and I was a young boy then. He then said: \"Welcome, son of my brother, ask what you wish.\" I asked him, and he was blind. The time of prayer came, and he stood wrapped in a mantle. Whenever he placed it on his shoulder, its ends fell due to its shortness, and his gown was placed on a rack by his side. He led us in prayer. I said: \"Tell me about the Hajj of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him).\" He signaled with his hand and folded his fingers, indicating nine. He said: \"The Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) remained nine years during which he did not perform Hajj. Then, there was a public announcement in the tenth year to the effect that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) was about to perform Hajj. A large number of people came to Mad\u012bnah, everyone desiring to follow the example of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) and act like him. We went out with him until we reached Dhu al-Hulayfah. Asm\u0101\u2019 bint \u2018Umays gave birth to Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr. She sent a message to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) asking him: 'What should I do?' He said: 'Take a bath, bandage your private parts with a cloth, and assume Ihr\u0101m.' The Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) prayed in the mosque and then mounted Al-Qasw\u0101\u2019, and his she-camel stood erect with him on its back, on Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019 (the wilderness). I looked as far as I could see and saw (many) people on mounts, on foot in front of him, a similar number on his right side,  a similar number on his left side, and a similar number behind him. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) was among us, the Qur\u2019an was being revealed to him, and he knew its interpretation. Whatever he did according to it, we did it. He then raised his voice as he declared Allah\u2019s oneness: 'Labbayka allahumma labbayk, labbayka la shar\u012bka laka labbayk, inna al-hamda wa an-ni\u2018mata laka wa al-mulk, la shar\u012bka lak (I am at Your service, O Allah, You have no partner; the praise, the favor, and the dominion belong to You. You have no partner). The people raised their voices too saying this as they wanted to say. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) did not make any comment and he (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) continued his Talbiyah. J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We did not intend to perform anything but Hajj. We did not know \u2018Umrah. When we came with him to the House, he touched the Corner, doing Ramal (brisk walk) for three rounds and walking for four. Then, he went forward to the Maq\u0101m Ibrahim (Station of Abraham) (peace be upon him). He recited: {And take the station of Abraham as a place of prayer} [Surat al-Baqarah: 125]. He kept the Station between him and the House. My father used to say: 'I do not know that he narrated it from anyone except the Prophet (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him).' He used to recite in the two Rak\u2018ahs the Surahs of: {Say: 'He is Allah, the One'} and: {Say: 'O disbelievers.'} He then returned to the Corner and touched it, after which he went out by the gate to Safa. When he reached near Safa, he recited: '{Indeed, Safa and Marwah [mounts] are among the symbols of Allah} [Surat al Baqarah: 158]. I begin with what Allah began with.' He then began with Safa and ascended it until he saw the House and faced the Qiblah. So, he declared the oneness of Allah, proclaimed his greatness, and said: La ilaha illa Allahu wahdahu la shar\u012bka lah, lahu al-mulku wa lahu al-hamd, wa huwa \u2018ala kulle shay\u2019in qad\u012br, la ilaha illahu wahdahu, anjaza wa\u2018dah, wa nasara abdah, wa hazama al-ahz\u0101baha wahdah (There is no god but Allah, alone, with no partner. The dominion and the praise belong to Him, and He is Able to do all things. There is no god but Allah, alone. He fulfilled His promise, supported His servant, and routed the confederates, alone.) He then supplicated during that, saying such words three times. Then, he descended to Marwah, and when his feet reached the bottom of the valley, he walked quickly, and when we ascended, he walked, until he reached Marwah. He did at Marwah what he did at Safa, and when it was the end of his Taw\u0101f at Marwah, he said: 'If I had known before what I came to know afterward regarding this matter of mine, I would not have brought sacrificial animals and would have made it an \u2018Umrah; so, if any of you has no sacrificial animals, he may end his Ihr\u0101m and make it an \u2018Umrah.' Thereupon, Sur\u0101qah ibn M\u0101lik ibn Ju\u2018shum got up and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, does this apply to the present year or forever?' The Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) intertwined his fingers and said: '\u2018Umrah has been incorporated in Hajj - twice - No, but forever and ever.' \u2018Ali came from Yemen with the sacrificial animals of the Prophet (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) and found F\u0101timah (may Allah be pleased with her) among one of those who had taken off their Ihr\u0101m, and she put on colored clothes and used cohl into her eyes. He expressed disapproval of that, so she said: 'My father commanded me to do this.' He said: \u2018Ali said in Iraq: 'I went to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) to complain against F\u0101timah for what she had done and to ask for the opinion of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) regarding what she had mentioned to me. He said: 'She spoke the truth; she spoke the truth. What did you say when you put on Ihr\u0101m for Hajj?' He said: 'O Allah, I put on Ihr\u0101m for the same purpose for which Your Messenger has put it on.' He said: 'I have sacrificial animals with me; so, do not take off Ihr\u0101m.' He said: The total of those sacrificial animals brought by \u2018Ali from Yemen and of those brought by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was one hundred. He said: Then, all the people except the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and those who had the sacrificial animals with them took off their Ihr\u0101ms and shortened their hair. When the Day of Tarwiyah came, they went towards Mina having put on their Ihr\u0101ms for Hajj, and the Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) rode and prayed the Zhuhr, \u2018Asr, Maghrib, \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019, and Fajr prayers at Mina. After that, he waited a little until the sun rose and gave orders for a tent of hair to be set up at Namirah. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) proceeded, and the Quraysh had no doubt that he would halt at Al-Mash\u2018ar Al-Har\u0101m, as the Quraysh used to do in J\u0101hiliyyah; but he kept on until he reached \u2018Arafah and found that the tent had been set up at Namirah. There, he dismounted, and when the sun had passed the meridian, he ordered for Al-Qasw\u0101' to be brought, and when it was saddled for him, he went down to the bottom of the valley and addressed the people, saying: 'Indeed, your blood and your property are as inviolable to you as this day of yours in this month of yours in this town of yours. Lo! Everything pertaining to J\u0101hiliyyah has been put under my feet and claims for blood vengeance belonging to J\u0101hiliyyah have been abolished. The first of those murdered among us whose blood vengeance I remit is the son of Rab\u012b\u2018ah ibn al-H\u0101rith. He was suckled among Banu Sa\u2018d and then killed by Hudhayl. The usury of J\u0101hiliyyah is abolished, and the first of usury which I abolish is our usury, the usury of \u2018Abb\u0101s ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib, for it is all abolished. Fear Allah regarding women, for you have got them under Allah\u2019s security and have the right to intercourse with them by Allah\u2019s word. It is your right upon them that they should not allow anyone whom you dislike to step on your mattresses; so, if they do that, beat them, but not severely. You are responsible for providing them with food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you something, if you hold on to it, you will never again go astray: the Book of Allah. You will be asked about me, so what will you say?' They said: 'We testify that you have conveyed, fulfilled, and given advice.' Then, he raised his forefinger towards the sky, and pointing it at the people, he said: 'O Allah, bear witness; O Allah, bear witness,' three times. Then, Bil\u0101l called the Adh\u0101n and then the Iq\u0101mah, and he performed the Zhuhr prayer. Then, he called the Iq\u0101mah, and he offered the \u2018Asr prayer, offering no prayer between the two. Then, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) rode and came to the place of standing, making Al-Qasw\u0101\u2019 turn its back to the rocks and having the path taken by those who went on foot in front of him, and he faced the Qiblah. He remained standing until sunset, and the yellow light had somewhat gone, until the disc of the sun had disappeared. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) took Us\u0101mah up behind him and severely picked the rein of Al-Qasw\u0101\u2019, so much so that its head was touching the front part of the saddle. Pointing with his right hand, he said: 'O people, calmness, calmness.' Whenever he ascended a mound, he let its rein a little loose so that it could ascend, until he came to Muzdalifah, where he performed the Maghrib and \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayers with one Adh\u0101n and two Iq\u0101mahs. He did not offer supererogatory prayers between them. Then, he lay down until dawn and performed the Fajr prayer when the morning light was clear, with one Adh\u0101n and one Iq\u0101mah. Then, he mounted Al-Qasw\u0101\u2019 and came to Al-Mash\u2018ar Al-Har\u0101m. He faced the Qiblah, supplicated to Him, and proclaimed His greatness, glorified Him, and declared His oneness, and he kept standing until the daylight was noticeably clear. Then, he departed before the sun rose and made Al-Fadl ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s ride behind him, and he was a man with beautiful hair, white, and handsome. When the Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) departed, women in howdahs began to quickly pass him by. Al-Fadl began to look at them. So, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) placed his hand on the face of Al-Fadl, but Al-Fadl turned his face towards the other side, looking. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) also turned his hand to the other side, and Al-Fadl also turned his face to the other side, looking at them until he reached the Valley of Muhassir. He urged the camel a little and following a middle road that leads to Al-Jamrah Al-Kubra, he came to the Jamrah that is beside the tree and threw seven small pebbles at it, saying Takb\u012br with each pebble of them - pebbles like date stones. He threw them from the bottom of the valley. Then, he went to the place of the sacrifice and sacrificed sixty-three camels with his own hand. He then let \u2018Ali sacrifice the remainder, and he shared his sacrificial animals with him. After that, he ordered that a piece of flesh from each camel be put in a pot, and when it was cooked, the two of them ate some of it and drank some of its broth. Then, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) rode and headed to the House and performed the Zhuhr prayer in Makkah. He then went to Banu \u2018Abd al-Muttalib, who were supplying water at Zamzam, and said: 'Draw water, Banu \u2018Abd al-Muttalib! Were it not that people would take the right to draw water from you, I would draw it along with you.' So, they handed him a bucket and he drank from it.\".", "commentary": "Hajj is the fifth among the pillars of Islam. It is an act of worship for those who can find a way to it. All its actions are taken from the Sunnah of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). The T\u0101bi\u2018\u012bs would go to the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to ask them and learn from them the Had\u012bths of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and what he did and said regarding the acts of worship.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Muhammad ibn \u2018Ali ibn al-Husayn, known as Al-B\u0101qir - one of the descendants of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) - relates that he and others entered the place of J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him), who asked about those who entered, one by one. J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) was blind at the time, as he became blind in the latter part of his life. When he asked about Muhammad ibn \u2018Ali ibn Husayn, and he said his name to him, he extended his hand to Muhammad's head and undid the upper button on his shirt and then undid the lower button, i.e., he loosened it from the buttonhole to reveal his chest and place his hand on it, out of complete compassion towards him, for he is one of the household of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). He welcomed him. J\u0101bir did that with him to give him a friendly feeling in light of his young age, as Muhammad was a young boy at the time. He said to him: \"Welcome, son of my brother.\" He meant the brotherhood of religion, not blood relationship. All that J\u0101bir did was out of extreme respect for the Prophet's household, in recognition of their status, and to distinguish them from others and treat them in a manner that befits their rank.\nJ\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) told him to ask him whatever he wished, which he did. The time of prayer came. So, J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) stood wrapped in a mantle. Whenever he placed it on his shoulder, its ends fell off his shoulder due to its shortness, and his Rid\u0101\u2019, the garment that covers the upper body, was placed on a rack by his side. A rack is a group of sticks or pieces of wood whose heads are joined together, whereas their pillars have space in between; clothes are hung over it. J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) led them in prayer, offering that prayer whose time came. After the prayer, Muhammad ibn \u2018Ali ibn al-Husayn asked him to tell him about the Hajj of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) performed Hajj once, and it is called the Farewell Hajj. J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) pointed with his hand and folded nine of his fingers, as the Arabs would use their fingers in counting. It is as if he wanted to count from one to nine. Then, J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) remained in Mad\u012bnah for nine years after the Hijrah without performing Hajj. Then, in the tenth year after Hijrah, he ordered for a public announcement to be made to inform the people that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was going to perform Hajj that year. This is because he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was keen to gather a large number of his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), for them to prepared for Hajj with him, learn the rituals and rulings, observe his words and actions, and so that he would give them advice. Thus, those who were present would inform those who were absent, and the call of Islam would spread. The public announcement was not limited to the people of Mad\u012bnah only, but it extended to all places and regions. As a result, a lot of people came to Mad\u012bnah, all desiring and seeking to follow the example of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and act like him in Hajj, for he was the role model.\nJ\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) says that they went out with him as five nights were remaining of the month of Dhul-Qi\u2018dah, as related in the version by An-Nas\u0101\u2019i and in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections, in a Had\u012bth in which \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that he left Mad\u012bnah by daytime after performing the Zhuhr prayer as four Rak\u2018ahs in Mad\u012bnah. He departed between the Zhuhr and \u2018Asr, until he reached Dhu al-Hulayfah, the Miq\u0101t of the people of Mad\u012bnah and non-residents who pass by it. It is a village located nearly 6 or 7 miles (10km) away from Mad\u012bnah. In modern times, it is known among the general public as Abiy\u0101r \u2018Ali or \u0100b\u0101r \u2018Ali and it lies 420km away from Makkah.\nIn this place, Asm\u0101\u2019 bint \u2018Umays, the wife of Abu Bakr as-Sidd\u012bq, gave birth to her son Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with them). She sent a message to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asking him about what she should do with her Ihr\u0101m after she entered into a postpartum period. In response, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) instructed her to take a bath for cleanliness, for the blood of postpartum bleeding does not cease except after the end of the postpartum period. Therefore, he ordered her, saying: \"and bandage your private parts with a cloth.\" This is to put a piece of cloth over the area of bleeding - the private parts - to stop the flow of blood. He (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ordered her to assume Ihr\u0101m with intention and Talbiyah. A woman in a menstrual or postpartum period can validly perform all the rituals of Hajj except for Taw\u0101f, as indicated by a Had\u012bth narrated by An-Nas\u0101\u2019i and Ibn M\u0101jah, in which Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"and she should do what people do,\" of Dhikr and Talbiyah, and stand at Mina, \u2018Araf\u0101t, and Muzdalifah, \"except that she may not perform Taw\u0101f around the House,\" i.e., she may not perform Taw\u0101f Ar-Rukn around the honorable Ka\u2018bah unless she becomes pure of the postpartum bleeding, after which she can do Taw\u0101f.\nThen, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) offered the Zhuhr prayer as two Rak\u2018ahs, before leaving the Miq\u0101t and after assuming Ihr\u0101m. The day when the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) reached Dhu al-Hulayfah, he offered the \u2018Asr prayer as two Rak\u2018ahs. Then, he performed the Maghrib, \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019, Fajr, and Zhuhr prayers there; thus, he offered five prayers in it and stayed for a day and a night. He probably stayed in that place so that people would successively come to him, and they would thus be acquainted with the manner of his Hajj from its start, as Hajj begins from the Miq\u0101t where Ihr\u0101m is assumed.\nThereafter, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) mounted Al-Qasw\u0101\u2019, the name of his riding she-camel, and his she-camel stood erect with him on its back, in \"Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019''. Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019 in Arabic language means the empty desert. But here it refers to a certain place between Makkah and Mad\u012bnah, and it is located above the two signposts of Dhu al-Hulayfah for those who ascend from the valley. At the beginning of Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019 lies a well. J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) says that he looked as far as he could see before him and found people around the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), some of whom were riding and others on foot - they were in front of him, on his right side, on his left side, and behind him. The words of J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) indicate the large number of people and their presence and show how much they were keen to pursue the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him); they did what he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did, and they followed him and adhered to his course and way. Then, J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) clarified that the people did that out of their belief that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was the one to whom the Qur'an was revealed, and so he was the one who knew its interpretation and the explanation of its meanings and objectives, which included the rituals of Hajj and \u2018Umrah.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) raised his voice as he proclaimed the word of Tawh\u012bd; he said: Labbayka allahumma labbayk, labbayka la shar\u012bka laka labbayk, inna al-hamda wa an-ni\u2018mata laka wa al-mulk, la shar\u012bka lak (I am at Your service, O Allah, You have no partner; the praise, the favor, and the dominion belong to You. You have no partner). It means I repeat my response to You in my compliance with Your command to perform Hajj, for You are the One Who is worthy of gratitude and praise, because You alone possess the ultimate perfection, and You are the true Bestower of favor. There is no favor except that it comes from You; and You are the sole Possessor of the enduring ownership, and every ownership of anyone other than Yours is doomed to vanish. The wisdom behind Talbiyah is to point out the honor Allah Almighty bestows upon His servants as they come to His House in response to a call from Him, which contradicts the words of Shirk the polytheists who used to say in their Talbiyah during the J\u0101hiliyyah era. They used to say: \"Labbayk la shar\u012bka lak illa shar\u012bkan howa lak, tamlikuhu wa ma malak (You have no partner except for a partner who You own, You possess him and what he possesses), according to a Had\u012bth narrated by Muslim and reported by Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him).\nJ\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"The people too raised their voices saying what they used to say,\" i.e., they did not commit to this particular Talbiyah which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) proclaimed. This is demonstrated by a Had\u012bth in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections, in which Anas ibn M\u0101lik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"People would say Talbiyah and they were not criticized, and people would say Takb\u012br and they were not criticized;\" and the Had\u012bth narrated by Muslim, in which \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that he used to say Talbiyah like the Talbiyah said by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and add the following to it: \"Labbayk, Labbayk, wa sa\u2018dayk, wa al-khayru biyadayka labbayk, wa ar-raghba\u2019 ilayka wa al-\u2018amal (I am here ready to obey You. Good is in Your Hands. Reward is sought from You, and work is done for Your sake.\" There are other relevant Had\u012bths reported by the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), as they understood that it is not specified. Hence, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not reject any of these; he would hear them and not criticize them. His silence denotes the approval of their Talbiyahs.\nJ\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) mentioned that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) continued to say his Talbiyah and kept to it. Then, J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"We did not intend to perform anything but Hajj.\" This was in the beginning, at the time of their departure from Mad\u012bnah; otherwise, some of them actually assumed Ihr\u0101m for \u2018Umrah; or he was talking about the case applying to most of them; or that the main objective of their departure was to perform Hajj, even if some of them intended to perform \u2018Umrah. J\u0101bir then said: \"We did not know \u2018Umrah.\" He probably said that about their initial condition, before Ihr\u0101m. They used to regard the performance of \u2018Umrah in the months of Hajj as a heinous immorality. But when it was the time of Ihr\u0101m, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) made things clear to them, saying, as narrated in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections: \"Whoever wants to assume Ihr\u0101m for Hajj, let him do so. Whoever wants to assume Ihr\u0101m for \u2018Umrah, let him do so, and whoever wants to assume Ihr\u0101m for Hajj and \u2018Umrah, let him do so.\" This dispelled the illusion they had harbored, and they remained like that.\nWhen they reached Makkah - which happened on the morning of the 4th day of Dhul-Hijjah - the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his Companions came to the Ka\u2018bah, and he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) touched the Corner, by which he meant the Black Stone. Touching it includes passing the hand over it and kissing it. Then, he began Taw\u0101f around the House, doing it for seven rounds. In the first three rounds, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) took quick and short steps, whereas he walked normally in the other four rounds. He would start the round from the front of the Black Stone and would finish it there.\nAfter he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) finished the Taw\u0101f around the Ka\u2018bah, he headed to the Station of Abraham and recited the verse that reads: {Take the Station of Abraham as a place for prayer.} [Surat al-Baqarah: 125], i.e., O people, take the Station of Abraham as a place of prayer where you pray, as an act of worship from you to Allah Almighty, and as an honor to Abraham (peace be upon him) from Allah, Exalted be He. This is after finishing the Taw\u0101f around the Ka\u2018bah, with the Station lying between the House and the praying person. The Station of Abraham is the place of his standing. It is the stone upon which Abraham (peace be upon him) stood at the time of his construction of the Ka\u2018bah, and it has his footprint. Its location is well-known nowadays beside the Ka\u2018bah. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) made the Station between himself and the House and prayed behind the Station, in compliance with Allah's command.\nJa\u2018far ibn Muhammad says that his father Muhammad related from J\u0101bir that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) recited in these two Rak\u2018ahs Surat: {Say: \"O disbelievers\"} in the first Rak\u2018ah, after Al-F\u0101tihah, and in the second Rak\u2018ah Surat: {Say: \"He is Allah, the One\"}, as related in Sunan At-Tirmidhi and Sunan An-Nas\u0101\u2019i. The version here is not meant to specify the order.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) returned after offering the two Rak\u2018ahs of Taw\u0101f to the Black Stone once again and touched it. Thereafter, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went out from the gate of Banu Makhz\u016bm, which is known as the gate of Safa. He (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went out through it because it was the nearest gate to Mount Safa, and because Safa and Marwah were then located outside the Mosque. When he approached Mount Safa, he recited the verse that reads: {Indeed, Safa and Marwah [mounts] are among the symbols of Allah.} [Surat al-Baqarah: 158] And he said: \"I begin with what Allah has begun with,\" i.e., Allah Almighty mentioned Safa first; so, we begin with it in Sa\u2018i. It was called Safa because its stones are of the Safa type, which is smooth and hard. It is located at the bottom of Mount Abu Qubays. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) began Sa\u2018i from Safa and ascended Mount Safa until he could see the honorable Ka\u2018bah, then he faced the Qiblah, declared the oneness of Allah, proclaimed his greatness, and said: \"There is no god but Allah, alone,\" He is One in divinity and in Essence, \"with no partner to Him\" in divinity or attributes. \"The dominion and the praise belong to Him,\" i.e., He possesses everything, and He can dispose of His dominion as He wishes. And to Him belongs the greatness and the good laudation and comprehensive gratitude for His favors and grace. \"and He is Able to do all things;\" nothing escapes His power. The absolute ability belongs to Him, Exalted be He. \"There is no god but Allah, alone; He fulfilled His promise,\" i.e., He fulfilled the promise He made to him that He, Exalted be He, would make the religion dominant. \"supported His servant,\" i.e., He gave a great victory to His Prophet Muhammad (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). \"and routed the confederates alone,\" i.e., He defeated them without fighting by human beings and without a cause on their part. The confederates are those who allied together against the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) during the battle of the Trench in the 5 A.H. He uttered this Dhikr three times and supplicated with what Allah enabled him to say after each time.\nThen, he descended and walked to Marwah, and when his feet went down and headed downwards \"at the bottom of the valley,\" which refers to the low area between the two mountains, \"he walked quickly,\" i.e., he hastened his steps. When his feet ascended and went upwards, he walked normally, until he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came and went up on Mount Marwah, which is a high place at the bottom of Mount Qu\u2018ayqi\u2018\u0101n, in the north-east of the Sacred Mosque. He (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did at Marwah what he had done at Safa, facing the Qiblah and engaging in Dhikr and supplication. The Prophet's Sa\u2018i between Safa and Marwah consisted of seven rounds. From Safa to Marwah is one round, and from Marwah to Safa is another round. He would begin with Safa and end with Marwah. The place of the Prophet's Sa\u2018i is now highlighted and marked with green lamps hung on the ceiling along the distance for which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) performed Sa\u2018i.\nWhen he was in the last part of his Taw\u0101f - the seventh round that would end at Marwah - he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them): \"If I had known before what I have come to know afterwards regarding this matter of mine,\" i.e., If I had known at the beginning of the matter what I came to know at its end - that is the permissibility of performing \u2018Umrah in the months of Hajj - I would not have brought sacrificial animals with me from outside Makkah and would have performed a Tamattu\u2018 Hajj. He wanted to do the opposite of what the people of J\u0101hiliyyah used to do in their beliefs and deeds. The existence of sacrificial animals prevents the pilgrim from ending the Ihr\u0101m of Hajj and making it an \u2018Umrah and then ending its Ihr\u0101m. The matter the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came to know afterward is the hardship faced by his Companions as they ended their Ihr\u0101m apart from him; they even stopped, hesitated, and came back to ask him. By contrast, those who did not bring sacrificial animals with them could end the Ihr\u0101m for Hajj and turn it into \u2018Umrah. His statement \"If I had known before...\" was meant to comfort his Companions whom he ordered to end their Hajj and turn it into \u2018Umrah, because they had not brought the sacrificial animals with them. Sacrificial animals are the cattle, camels, and sheep that are gifted to the House as a means of closeness to Allah Almighty. This also indicates that Tamattu\u2018 is better than Qir\u0101n and Ifr\u0101d, and that if the sacrificial animals are brought, the performer of Qir\u0101n and Ifr\u0101d Hajj remains in his Ihr\u0101m until the Day of Nahr.\nSur\u0101qah ibn M\u0101lik ibn Ju\u2018shum (may Allah be pleased with him) asked the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): \"Does this apply to the present year or forever?\" i.e., is the permissibility of ending Hajj and turning it into \u2018Umrah and performing \u2018Umrah in the months of Hajj, or along with Hajj particularly related to this year or it applies forever? Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) intertwined his fingers and said: \"\u2018Umrah has been incorporated in Hajj,\" i.e., \u2018Umrah has entered the months of Hajj. He said that twice. He then said: \"but forever and ever;\" this is a general ruling on the legitimacy of performing Tamattu\u2018 Hajj, doing \u2018Umrah before Hajj, in all years, not only a particular one.\nJ\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) said \u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib (may Allah be pleased with him) came from Yemen with sacrificial animals. Before his Hajj, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had sent him as a judge and collector of Zakah, and he returned, and on the way, he raised his voice in Talbiyah and intended to enter the rituals. When \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) entered Makkah, and he was yet to learn about the Tamattu\u2018 the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had commanded his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) to engage in, he found his wife F\u0101timah, the Prophet's daughter, to be one of those who ended their Ihr\u0101m, and she wore 'colored' clothing, which women are forbidden to wear under Ihr\u0101m, and she put kohl in her eyes. This all indicates she was fully adorned and had ended Ihr\u0101m. He expressed disapproval of that, thinking it to be impermissible. She informed him that it was the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) who commanded her to end the Ihr\u0101m. So, \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) went to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and complained to him about F\u0101timah (may Allah be pleased with her), i.e., he mentioned to him what entailed rebuking her for what she did; and he sought the Prophet's opinion about what she mentioned about him and that he expressed disapproval of what she did. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: \"She spoke the truth; she spoke the truth;\" he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) affirmed the trueness of what F\u0101timah (may Allah be pleased with her) informed him about.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked him: \"What did you say when you put on Ihr\u0101m for Hajj?\" i.e., what did you intend to perform when you assumed Ihr\u0101m: Hajj or \u2018Umrah, or both of them? \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) told him that he said: \"O Allah, I put on Ihr\u0101m for the same purpose for which Your Messenger has put it on,\" i.e., I assume the same Ihr\u0101m as the Ihr\u0101m of Your Messenger. So, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"I have sacrificial animals with me;\" this is to clarify why he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not end his Ihr\u0101m. \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) also brought the sacrificial animals with him. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) approved his assumption of Ihr\u0101m and instructed him to continue with it.\nThen, J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the total of sacrificial animals brought by \u2018Ali from Yemen and by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) from Mad\u012bnah was one hundred.\nThose who had not brought the sacrificial animals with them ended their Ihr\u0101m in compliance with the command of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and they cut their hair and stayed as non-Muhrims (out of Ihr\u0101m), engaging in things forbidden for them under Ihr\u0101m. He said, \"and shortened their hair,\" though shaving is better than shortening, as authentically reported from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Regarding that, it was said: So that some hair should remain until the rituals of Hajj and can be shaved on the Day of Nahr after throwing pebbles at Jamrat al-\u2018Aqabah.\nMeanwhile, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and those who had sacrificial animals with them did not end their Ihr\u0101m. When it was the Day of Tarwiyah - the 8th day of Dhul-Hijjah, and it was called as such because water in Mina was little, and they used to drink water from there and carry it for later - the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his Companions headed to Mina. The performers of Tamattu\u2018 Hajj assumed new Ihr\u0101ms for their Hajj. As for the performers of Qir\u0101n Hajj - the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and those who had sacrificial animals with them - they remained in their Ihr\u0101m. Ihr\u0101m should be assumed in the place where one alights, and the Companions alighted with the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in Al-Abtah, so they assumed Ihr\u0101m therein, as related in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections. Mina is a valley surrounded by mountains, which is located east of Makkah, on the road between Makkah and Mount \u2018Arafah, and it lies 6km away from the Sacred Mosque. Mina: It is a place where rituals of Hajj are performed, the pilgrims stay on the Day of Tarwiyah, the day of Eid al-Ad'ha, and the Days of Tashr\u012bq. It includes the area of throwing the Jamar\u0101t, which happens between the rise and setting of the sun in those days of Hajj, and it is where the sacrificial animals are slaughtered.\nJ\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) mentioned that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) mounted the she-camel upon the rise of the sun on the Day of Tarwiyah, and he offered the Zhuhr, \u2018Asr, Maghrib, \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019, and Fajr prayers at Mina, each prayer at its time. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) remained for a little after the performance of the Fajr prayer until the sun rose, and he ordered that a tent be set up for him - and it used to be made of hair, i.e., the hair of goats and wool of sheep - at Namirah before his arrival at \u2018Arafah. Namirah lies to the west of the Mash\u2018ar of \u2018Araf\u0101t, and part of the western side of the Namirah Mosque is located in the valley of \u2018Uranah.\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his Companions headed from Mina to the \u2018Arafah Mount, which lies outside the boundaries of the Sacred Mosque, on the road that links Makkah to T\u0101\u2019if. It is located 22km to the east of Makkah, 10km away from Mina, and 6km away from Muzdalifah; and its total area is estimated to be around 10.4km. The Quraysh had no doubt that he would stop at \"Al-Mash\u2018ar Al-Har\u0101m,\" a mountain in Muzdalifah which is called Quzah; this is where the mosque of Al-Mash\u2018ar Al-Har\u0101m is located, at the beginning of Muzdalifah. Some people from the Quraysh thought that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would do as the Quraysh used to do in J\u0101hiliyyah. In a version by Muslim: The Arabs in J\u0101hiliyyah would be prompted to perform Hajj by a man known as \"Abu Sayy\u0101rah\". He was a man from Banu Baj\u012blah called \u2018Umayrah ibn al-A\u2018lam, who used to ride a donkey without a packsaddle and with nothing for the rider to sit on. He would depart from Muzdalifah and not go out to \u2018Araf\u0101t.\nSo, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went past Muzdalifah and did not stop at it. Rather, he directly headed to \u2018Araf\u0101t. When he approached it, he found the tent set up at Namirah. He alighted at it and stayed there until the sun passed the meridian and moved from the middle of the sky, from the east to the west. He ordered for his she-camel Al-Qasw\u0101\u2019 to be brought, and the saddle was fastened on its back so that he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) could ride it. He rode it and came to the bottom of the valley, the valley of \u2018Uranah, which is one of the valleys of Makkah. It lies to the west of \u2018Araf\u0101t and cuts through the land of Al-Mughammas, passing by the end of \u2018Araf\u0101t from the western side, by the Namirah Mosque. Then, it meets with the valley of Nu\u2018m\u0101n and passes south of Makkah, at the boundaries of the Sacred Precincts. At this place, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) stood, addressed the people, and admonished them, saying: \"Indeed, your blood and your property,\" i.e., shedding your blood and taking your property without right \"are as inviolable to you\" in an emphatic manner like the inviolability of the day of \u2018Arafah, the inviolability of the month of Dhul-Hijjah, and the inviolability of Makkah. This denotes emphasis and severity.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Lo! Everything pertaining to J\u0101hiliyyah,\" i.e., what they newly introduced and the legislations they laid down in Hajj and other things before Islam. J\u0101hiliyyah: It is the period in which people were upon Shirk before the advent of Islam. It was given this name because of their prevalent ignorance. \"has been put under my feet,\" i.e., it is false and void and does not count. \"and claims for blood vengeance belonging to J\u0101hiliyyah have been abolished,\" i.e., they are abandoned, with no legal retribution, blood money, or expiation. The first of those murdered among us whose blood vengeance I remit and abolish - as the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would begin with himself - is the son of Rab\u012b\u2018ah ibn al-H\u0101rith ibn \u2018Abdul-Muttalib. Rab\u012b\u2018ah ibn al-H\u0101rith was the Prophet's cousin. No legal retribution or blood money was due regarding him; rather, these were void, for his case belongs to the claims for blood vengeance in J\u0101hiliyyah. \"He was suckled,\" i.e., this son had a wet nurse from Banu Sa\u2018d, and the tribe of Hudhayl killed him.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"The usury of J\u0101hiliyyah;\" usury is prohibited in J\u0101hiliyyah and Islam. Yet, he attributed it to J\u0101hiliyyah because they legalized it for themselves. Then, when Islam came, it established its unlawfulness. Usury is a transaction among people with an interest on principal debts and loans, be it the Fadl (excess) usury or the Nas\u012b\u2019ah (deferred) usury. Allah Almighty prohibited it and gave a warning regarding it. Allah Almighty says: {Those who consume usury will not stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except like those being beaten by Satan. That is because they say: \"Trade is just like usury.\" But Allah has permitted trade and forbidden usury. Whoever desists because of receiving admonition from his Lord may keep his past gains, and his case is left to Allah. But whoever returns to it, they are the people of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.} [Surat al-Baqarah: 275] His words \"is abolished\" mean false and void. All usurious transactions that had previously been conducted in J\u0101hiliyyah and part of them remains, this is void. Abolished here refers to the interest, not the principal amount, for it will be given back to its owner, as Allah Almighty also says: {However, if you repent, you may retain your capital.} [Surat al-Baqarah: 279] \"and the first of usury which I abolish is our usury, the usury of \u2018Abb\u0101s ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib, for it is all abolished.\" He began with the usury of his uncle Al-\u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) given his relation to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), so that the people would imitate him in words and deeds and abolish that from their debtors.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) advised them to be kind to women, saying: \"Fear Allah regarding women,\" i.e., fear the punishment of Allah Almighty for failing to observe the rights of your wives and their worldly and religious interests, by treating them fairly and taking care of their rights. \"for you have got them under Allah\u2019s security and have the right to intercourse with them by Allah\u2019s word,\" i.e., you married them by the Shariah of Allah, and Allah made sexual intercourse a right for you upon them. Thus, they are trusts with you. So, you should take care of these trusts and not subject them to harm or offense; rather, you should be benevolent to them and treat them kindly. The word of Allah refers to the contract, which relies on two words of proposal and acceptance from the guardian and the husband.\nWhen he enjoined kindness to women, he mentioned the rights due upon them, saying: \"It is your right upon them that they should not allow anyone whom you dislike stepping on your mattresses,\" i.e., those you dislike that they enter your houses, which applies to men and women, relatives, and non-relatives. It was said: This statement is not understood to denote prohibition from adultery, for this is prohibited with those the husband dislikes and those he does not dislike. \"However, if they did so\" and allowed in your houses those you dislike entering, without your approval, then you, O men, can discipline them, even if this discipline reaches the limit of beating; \"beat them, but not severely,\" i.e., not hard, or harsh beating. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) also mentioned the rights due upon men to their wives. Due to them is provision, including food, drink, dwelling, and clothing, as much as is sufficient for them, without extravagance or miserliness, or according to their condition in terms of poverty and richness.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"I have left among you something,\" i.e., within you. This is addressed to all Muslims, whet."}, {"number": 414, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) reported:  When the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came to Makkah, he went to the Stone and touched it and then walked to its right side, engaging in three rounds of Ramal (a fast walk), and walking four..", "commentary": "Hajj is the fifth among the pillars of Islam.

J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that when the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came to Makkah for Hajj, in the Farewell Hajj, during the 8th Hijri year, he headed to the Black Stone, which is located in the corner of the Ka\u2018bah close to the gate in the eastern side, and its height from the ground is two cubits and two-thirds of a cubit. \"And touched it,\" which includes wiping over it and kissing it. Then, he walked to the right and began circumambulating the Ka\u2018bah, with it being to his left. He performed Taw\u0101f around the House for seven rounds. He walked in a fast manner with short steps during the first three rounds and walked at the normal pace in the remaining four rounds.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that Taw\u0101f should be started from the Black Stone after touching it.\nIt also points out that the performer of Taw\u0101f should walk to the right after touching the Stone, with the House being to his left.\nAnd it demonstrates that one should engage in Ramal during the first three rounds in the Taw\u0101f of Qud\u016bm (arrival), and one should walk calmly in the last four rounds.."}, {"number": 415, "hadith": "J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"I slaughtered the sacrificial animals here, and all of Mina is a place of slaughter; so, slaughter your sacrificial animals in your dwellings; and I stood here, and all of \u2018Arafah is a place of standing; and I stood here, and all of Jam\u2018 is a place of standing.\".", "commentary": "Hajj is one of the pillars of Islam, and it is an act of worship for those who can find a way to it, and all its rituals must be taken from the Sunnah of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). This Had\u012bth reveals one of the aspects of the Prophet's performance of Hajj in the Farewell Hajj and demonstrates his leniency and compassion towards his Ummah with regard to standing at \u2018Arafah and Muzdalifah and the slaughter of sacrificial animals in Mina. He (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"I slaughtered the sacrificial animals here,\" i.e., I slaughtered them in this place of mine in Mina. The place where he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) slaughtered the sacrificial animals was Al-Jamrah As-Sughra, which is the first Jamrah after the Khayf Mosque in Mina. However, out of his desire to facilitate things for his Ummah, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"and all of Mina is a place of slaughter,\" i.e., it is valid to slaughter sacrificial animals anywhere in it. So, slaughter the sacrificial animals in your places and dwellings. Mina is a valley surrounded by mountains and located to the east of Makkah, on the way between Makkah and Mount \u2018Arafah, and it is situated nearly 6km away from the Sacred Mosque. Mina is the place where the rituals of Hajj are performed and the pilgrims stay during the day of Tarwiyah, the day of Eid al-Ad'ha, and the days of Tashr\u012bq, and it is the site of throwing the Jamar\u0101t, which happens between sunrise and sunset during these days of Hajj. The Hady (sacrificial animals by pilgrims) are also slaughtered there.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"and I stood here\" in my place at \u2018Arafah \"and all of \u2018Arafah is a place of standing\" where it is valid to stand on the ninth day of Dhul-Hijjah. Mount \u2018Arafah lies outside the boundaries of the Sacred Mosque, on the way between Makkah and T\u0101\u2019if, and it is located nearly 22km away from Makkah, 10km from Mina, and 6km from Muzdalifah.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"and I stood here, and all of Jam\u2018 is a place of standing,\" i.e., I stood here in Muzdalifah at Al-Mash\u2018ar Al-Har\u0101m, and all of Muzdalifah is a place of standing. Muzdalifah is the name for the place where the pilgrims alight after departing from \u2018Araf\u0101t and stay there for the night of the tenth day of Dhul-Hijjah. It includes Al-Mash\u2018ar Al-Har\u0101m and is situated nearly 12km away from \u2018Arafah and next to the Mash\u2018ar of Mina. Muzdalifah was called 'Jam\u2018' because the Maghrib and \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayers are combined there (combining in Arabic: Jam\u2018). It is also said: It was named after the practice of its people, as they gather (Yajtami\u2018) therein and seek closeness to Allah (Yazdalif) by standing in it.\nThe Had\u012bth points to the validity of standing anywhere at \u2018Arafah and Muzdalifah.\nIt indicates that all of Mina is a place of slaughter, and it is valid to slaughter the sacrificial animals at any place therein.\nThe Had\u012bth urges us not to jostle against one another at the rituals of Hajj and to disperse across the places.."}, {"number": 416, "hadith": "Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) reported:  Tamattu\u2018 in Hajj was for the Companions of Muhammad (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in particular..", "commentary": "Tamattu\u2018 in Hajj is when a pilgrim intends to perform \u2018Umrah along with Hajj.

In other words, dissolving Hajj and turning it into \u2018Umrah pertained to the Companions alone. This is because the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ordered some of his Companions, who had not brought the sacrificial animals with them, to do this during the Farewell Hajj. Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) was one of those who dissolved their Hajj and turned it into \u2018Umrah. As for the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and the other Companions who had brought the sacrificial animals with them, they were performers of Qir\u0101n Hajj, i.e., they combined Hajj and \u2018Umrah with one Ihr\u0101m.\nHis statement contradicts some Sah\u012bh Hadiths that are authentically reported from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), which indicate that Tamattu\u2018 is permissible during the months of Hajj. It is said: The statement of Abu Dharr is taken to mean that the due and compulsory dissolution was that which the Prophet's Companions did. As for others, this is only recommended.\nIn a Had\u012bth in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections - and the wording here is by Muslim - J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"If I had known before what I came to know afterward regarding this matter of mine, I would not have brought the sacrificial animals but made it an \u2018Umrah. So, if any of you has no sacrificial animals, he may dissolve his Ihr\u0101m and turn it into an \u2018Umrah.\" Thereupon, Sur\u0101qah ibn M\u0101lik ibn Ju\u2018shum got up and said: \"O Messenger of Allah, does this apply to this year of ours, or forever?\" i.e., is the permissibility to dissolve Hajj and turn it into \u2018Umrah and to perform \u2018Umrah during the months of Hajj or along with Hajj related to this year or does it apply forever? \"Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon him) intertwined his fingers\" signaling that this applies to all years, and not one year in particular \"and said: 'The \u2018Umrah has been incorporated in Hajj - twice - No, but forever and ever,'\" i.e., \u2018Umrah has become permissible during the months of Hajj. This means: It is legitimate to perform \u2018Umrah during the months of Hajj and to perform it along with Hajj.\nIn a Had\u012bth in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections, \u2018Imr\u0101n ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The verse of Tamattu\u2018 was revealed in the Book of Allah - meaning Tamattu\u2018 Hajj - and the Messenger (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ordered us to perform it. Then, no verse was revealed to abrogate the verse on Tamattu\u2018 Hajj, and the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not prohibit it until he passed away.

They would prohibit \u2018Umrah until the end of the month of Muharram. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) abolished the habits of J\u0101hiliyyah, including the prohibition of \u2018Umrah during the months of Hajj, and established the Shariah of Islam.\nIn this tradition, Ghunaym ibn Qays says that he asked the Companion Sa\u2018d ibn Abi Waqq\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) about Tamattu\u2018 in Hajj. Tamattu\u2018 in Hajj is when a pilgrim intends to perform \u2018Umrah along with Hajj.

This is because these houses were covered with fronds of date palms.\nAccordingly, the Tamattu\u2018 here in the words of Sa\u2018d (may Allah be pleased with him) is intended to refer to the \u2018Umrah performed during the 7th Hijri year, which was offered to make up for an earlier missed \u2018Umrah. Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah was a disbeliever at the time. He embraced Islam thereafter, during the year of the Conquest of Makkah, in 8 A.H.

His forbiddance, however, was not meant as prohibition. Rather, he intended to encourage people to perform Hajj of Ifr\u0101d only, since \u2018Umrah is available all year long. So, \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) did not prohibit Tamattu\u2018 altogether. He only wanted to encourage Ifr\u0101d.\nIn a version by Muslim, \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"So, separate your Hajj from your \u2018Umrah. This makes your Hajj more complete and your \u2018Umrah more complete.\" This points to his forbiddance of Tamattu\u2018 in Hajj. Perhaps he saw this as more perfect for both acts of worship, or he probably based his opinion on another meaning, such that people should not cease to come to the House; rather, they should frequent it, coming once for Hajj and another time for \u2018Umrah - and Allah knows best.\nThe Had\u012bth shows that the Companions engaged in Ijtih\u0101d regarding religious rulings, and some of them objected to others citing religious texts.\nIt demonstrates the validity of Tamattu\u2018 in Hajj, as the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) made some of his wives observe it.."}, {"number": 419, "hadith": "Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported:  I heard the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) pronouncing Talbiyah for Hajj and \u2018Umrah together. Bakr said: I narrated that to Ibn \u2018Umar, who said: \"He pronounced Talbiyah for Hajj only.\" I met Anas and narrated to him the words of Ibn \u2018Umar, and he said: \"You only count us as children. I heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) saying: Labbayk \u2018Umrah and Hajj.\".", "commentary": "Hajj is the fifth among the pillars of Islam. It is an act of worship for those who can find a way to it, and all its rituals must be taken from the Prophet's Sunnah. The T\u0101bi\u2018\u012bs used to go to the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to ask them and learn from them the Had\u012bths of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his words and deeds in the acts of worship.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Anas ibn M\u0101lik (may Allah be pleased with him) informs that he heard the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) \"pronouncing Talbiyah for Hajj and \u2018Umrah together\" in the Farewell Hajj. This indicates that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was performing Hajj of Qir\u0101n. Then, Bakr ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h - who narrated this Had\u012bth from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) - informed that he related to \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) what Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said. Thereupon, \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him), commenting on the statement of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him), said: \"He pronounced Talbiyah for Hajj only\" i.e., the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was performing Hajj of Ifr\u0101d and did not perform \u2018Umrah with it. Bakr stated that he returned to Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) and told him about this statement by Ibn \u2018Umar; thereupon, Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"You only count us as children\" i.e., you only consider us to be children who know nothing about the conditions and Sunnahs of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). He (may Allah be pleased with him) was alluding to his young age during the period in which he accompanied and served the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). When the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came to Mad\u012bnah as an emigrant, Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) was aged ten at the time. Accordingly, Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) was twenty years old during the Farewell Hajj. So, Had\u012bths are to be accepted from him, especially after he reached the age of adolescence and maturity. So, by these words of his, Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) expressed disapproval of anyone who may think this way about him. He, therefore, said: \"I heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) saying: Labbayk \u2018Umrah and Hajj.\" Thus, he (may Allah be pleased with him) affirmed what he narrated from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and that he saw and heard him do that.\nThe correct and more predominant view is that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) performed Hajj of Qir\u0101n, as stated by Anas. Whoever advocated a different view based it on what he saw the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) doing or heard him saying in the assumption of Ihr\u0101m. He who heard him assuming Ihr\u0101m for Hajj thought that he performed Hajj of Ifr\u0101d; he who heard him assuming Ihr\u0101m for \u2018Umrah thought that he performed Hajj of Tamattu\u2018; and he who heard him assuming Ihr\u0101m for Hajj and \u2018Umrah together knew that he performed Hajj of Qir\u0101n, making Hajj and \u2018Umrah with one Ihr\u0101m, and that \u2018Umrah was incorporated into the rituals of Hajj.."}, {"number": 420, "hadith": "Wabarah reported:  A man asked Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him): \"May I perform Taw\u0101f around the House while I have assumed Ihr\u0101m for Hajj?\" He said: \"What prevents you from doing that?\" He said: \"I saw the son of so-and-so expressing disapproval of it, and you are dearer to us than him. We saw that he was allured by worldly life.\" Thereupon, he said: \"And who amongst us - or amongst you - has not been allured by worldly life?\" Then, he said: \"We saw the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) assuming Ihr\u0101m for Hajj, performing Taw\u0101f around the House, and making Sa\u2018i between Safa and Marwah. So, the Sunnah of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) is more worthy of being followed than the Sunnah of so-and-so, if you are truthful.\".", "commentary": "Hajj is of great significance, and its rituals were taken in detail from the Prophet's Hajj. Hence, the T\u0101bi\u2018\u012bs (may Allah have mercy upon them) were keen to verify all that was reported and attributed to him (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) from his noble Companions (may Allah be pleased with them).\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Wabarah ibn \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n al-K\u016bfi relates that a man asked \u2018Abdull\u016bh ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him): Is it valid for me to perform Taw\u0101f around the House after assuming Ihr\u0101m and before standing at \u2018Arafah and performing the other rituals? His words \"while I have assumed Ihr\u0101m for Hajj\" mean that he assumed Ihr\u0101m for Hajj of Ifr\u0101d and was not performing Hajj of Tamattu\u2018 or Qir\u0101n. Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) asked him: What prevents you from starting with Taw\u0101f?! This indicates that Ibn \u2018Umar approved the performance of Taw\u0101f first. In response, the questioner said: \"I saw the son of so-and-so\", meaning \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him), \"expressing disapproval of it.\" In a version by Muslim: \"Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s says: Do not perform Taw\u0101f around the House until you have come to the standing.\" He (may Allah be pleased with him) used to forbid starting with Taw\u0101f before coming to \u2018Arafah. \"and you are dearer to us than him\"; he meant that he gave precedence to the view of Ibn \u2018Umar over the view of Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with them), alleging that Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) was allured by worldly life, for he was appointed as a governor of Basrah by his cousin \u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib (may Allah be pleased with him), and authority brings possible peril and temptation. As for Ibn \u2018Umar, he did not assume any post of authority.\nAs for the statement by Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him): \"And who amongst us has not been allured by worldly life?\" It stems from his asceticism, modesty, and fairness, and it came as a response to this man's criticism of Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) and demonstrated the merit of \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him).\nThen, Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) informed that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) assumed Ihr\u0101m for Hajj, performed Taw\u0101f al-Qud\u016bm around the House for seven rounds, and made Sa\u2018i between Safa and Marwah. This means that he started Taw\u0101f and Sa\u2018i before going out to Mina and \u2018Arafah. It is said: If a Muhrim performs Hajj of Ifr\u0101d, this Taw\u0101f counts as Taw\u0101f al-Qud\u016bm, and if he performs \u2018Umrah only or Hajj of Tamattu\u2018 or Qir\u0101n, this Taw\u0101f counts as the Taw\u0101f for \u2018Umrah, whether he intends it as such or not; and a performer of Hajj of Qir\u0101n is required to perform another Taw\u0101f for Al-Qud\u016bm.\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) is famously reported to have assumed Ihr\u0101m for Hajj of Qir\u0101n, performing Hajj and \u2018Umrah together. So, his Taw\u0101f was for the \u2018Umrah, and then \u2018Umrah was incorporated into the rituals of Hajj.\nThen, Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) outlined a rule for this man to follow in his pursuit of knowledge, namely that the Sunnah of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) is more worthy of being followed than the Sunnah of so-and-so. His words \"if you are truthful\" mean: If you are sincere in following the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), do not deviate from his practice.\nThe Had\u012bth shows the Companions' caution not to backbite or defame one another.\nIt indicates that it is unacceptable to praise oneself while despising others.."}, {"number": 421, "hadith": "Muhammad ibn \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n reported:  that a man from the people of Iraq said to him: \"Ask 'Urwah ibn az-Zubayr on behalf of me about a man who proclaims Talbiyah for Hajj and when performs Taw\u0101f around the House, may he end his Ihr\u0101m or not? If he tells you that he may not end his Ihr\u0101m, tell him that there is a man who advocates this opinion.\" He said: I asked him, and he said: \"He who proclaims Talbiyah for Hajj may not end his Ihr\u0101m except with Hajj.\" I said: \"There is a man who advocates this opinion.\" He said: \"How bad his opinion is!\" Then, the man came across me and asked me, and I related to him, and he said: \"Say to him: There is a man who reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did that, and what about Asm\u0101\u2019 and Az-Zubayr who did that?\" He said: I came to him and mentioned that to him, and he said: \"Who is this?\" I said: \"I do not know.\" He said: \"Why does he not come to me by himself and ask me?! I think he is an Iraqi.\" I said: \"I do not know.\" He said: \"He told a lie, for the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) performed Hajj, and \u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) informed me: that the first thing he began with when he came to Makkah was to make ablution and then perform Taw\u0101f around the House. Then, Abu Bakr performed Hajj, and the first thing he began with was Taw\u0101f around the House, and there was nothing else. Then, \u2018Umar did the same. Then, \u2018Uthm\u0101n performed Hajj, and I saw that he first began with Taw\u0101f around the House, and there was nothing else. Then Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah and \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Umar. Then, I performed Hajj with my father, Az-Zubayr ibn al-\u2018Aww\u0101m, and the first thing he began with was Taw\u0101f around the House, and there was nothing else. Then, I saw the Muh\u0101jir\u016bn and Ans\u0101r do that, and there was nothing else. Then, the last one I saw doing that was Ibn \u2018Umar; then, he did not break it with \u2018Umrah. This is Ibn \u2018Umar with them; why do they not ask him? And none among the past would start with anything when they set their feet before Taw\u0101f around the House, and then they would not end their Ihr\u0101m. I saw that when my mother and maternal aunt came, they would not start with anything before the House, around which they would perform Taw\u0101f, and then they would not end their Ihr\u0101m. My mother told me that she and her sister, Az-Zubayr, and so-and-so and so-and-so came to perform \u2018Umrah only, and after they wiped over the corner, they ended their Ihr\u0101m. He told a lie in what he mentioned about that..", "commentary": "In this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Muhammad ibn \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n ibn Nawfal al-Madani relates that a man from the people of Iraq said to him: \"Ask \u2018Urwah ibn az-Zubayr on behalf of me about a man who proclaims Talbiyah for Hajj.\" To proclaim Talbiyah is to say it in a loud voice. It here refers to assuming Ihr\u0101m for Hajj. And he reaches Makkah \"and when he performs Taw\u0101f\" al-Qud\u016bm \"around the House\", he may end his Ihr\u0101m once he performs Taw\u0101f, without making Taw\u0101f between Safa and Marwah, or not? It is said that the man meant to ask about dissolving Hajj and turning it into \u2018Umrah. If the reply of \u2018Urwah is that \"he may not end\" his Ihr\u0101m once he performs Taw\u0101f, \"tell him that there is a man\" - meaning \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) - who advocates the opinion that Hajj may be dissolved and turned into \u2018Umrah and Ihr\u0101m may be ended right after Taw\u0101f.\nMuhammad ibn \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n informed that he posed the question to \u2018Urwah as requested by this man. So, \u2018Urwah said: He who proclaims Talbiyah for Hajj \"may not end\" his Ihr\u0101m except with Hajj and after completing all the rituals of Hajj. In response, Muhammad informed him that a man believed that he might end his Ihr\u0101m once he performed Taw\u0101f. Thereupon, \u2018Urwah said: \"How bad his opinion is!\" He criticized this view held by him. Then, Muhammad ibn \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n said: \"The man\" who asked me to pose the question to 'Urwah \"came across me,\" i.e., he intercepted and met me and asked me about the reply of 'Urwah. I related to him what 'Urwah had said. Thereupon, the man said to Muhammad ibn \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n: Say to him: \"There is a man\", meaning Ibn' Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him), who held the view that if a person has not brought the Hady and he proclaimed Talbiyah for Hajj, he should end his Ihr\u0101m for Hajj after performing Taw\u0101f; and that whoever wants to continue his Hajj should not approach the House until he has returned from 'Araf\u0101t. He based his opinion on the command given by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to his Companions who did not bring the Hady to turn it into 'Umrah. Ibn' Abb\u0101s reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did that, i.e., he gave this instruction to his Companions who did not bring the Hady in the Farewell Hajj. This is known to have been the view adopted by Ibn' Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him), and the majority disagreed with him.\nHe also urged him to ask him about Asm\u0101' bint Abi Bakr and Az-Zubayr ibn al-\u2018Aww\u0101m (may Allah be pleased with both of them), 'Urwah's parents, and the fact that they ended their Ihr\u0101m once they performed Taw\u0101f. So, Muhammad ibn \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n went to \u2018Urwah and mentioned that to him. Thereupon, \u2018Urwah asked him about the questioner who sent him with these questions. Muhammad told him that he did not know him. \u2018Urwah said: Why does he not come to me himself and ask me? I think he is an Iraqi. This is because they were known at the time for their rigidity in religious matters. Muhammad replied: I do not know. \u2018Urwah said: He lied as he attributed this action to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and also attributed it to Asm\u0101' and Az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with both of them). Indeed, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) performed Hajj, and \u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) - she was his maternal aunt - informed me: \"that the first thing he began with\", i.e., when the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came to Makkah, was to make ablution and then perform Taw\u0101f al-Qud\u016bm around the House. Then, he completed the activities and rituals of Hajj. And that when Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) set out for Hajj after the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), the first thing he would start with was Taw\u0101f around the House. \"And there was nothing else,\" i.e. he did not change Hajj, dissolve it, and turn it into 'Umrah or Hajj of Qir\u0101n. Then, \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b and \u2018Uthm\u0101n did like him, and then Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah, \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Umar, and Az-Zubayr ibn al-\u2018Aww\u0101m (may Allah be pleased with them), and then the Muh\u0101jir\u016bn and Ans\u0101r; they would start with Taw\u0101f al-Qud\u016bm. Then, Ibn' Umar was the last one I saw doing that - i.e., starting with Taw\u0101f. \"Then, he did not break it with 'Umrah,\" i.e., he did not dissolve it and turn it into 'Umrah. Instead, he continued his Ihr\u0101m until he finished it. \"This is Ibn 'Umar\" present \"with them, why do they not ask him?\" about the matters of their religion, if they are truthful in following the Sunnah! Likewise, there was none among the Companions who passed by except that they would start with Taw\u0101f around the House when they set their feet, and then they would not end their Ihr\u0101m right after Taw\u0101f.\nThen, \u2018Urwah ibn az-Zubayr informed that he saw that when his mother Asm\u0101\u2019 bint Abu Bakr and his maternal aunt \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah, Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with both of them), came to Makkah, the first thing they would do was Taw\u0101f al-Qud\u016bm around the House, and they would not end their Ihr\u0101m right after Taw\u0101f. \"My mother told me that she and her sister\" '\u0100\u2019ishah, the affirmer of the truth, came to Makkah, and with them were \"Az-Zubayr and so-and-so and so-and-so\", listing names of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), \"to perform 'Umrah only\" in the past, \"After they wiped over the corner,\" i.e., the Black Stone, and started Taw\u0101f from there, completed their Taw\u0101f around the House and their Sa'i between Safa and Marwah, and shaved their heads, \"they ended their Ihr\u0101m.\" \"He\", i.e., the questioner, \"told a lie in what he mentioned about that\", i.e., the ending of Ihr\u0101m right after Taw\u0101f.\nThe Had\u012bth demonstrates that the first thing to be done within the Sacred Precincts is to start with the Taw\u0101f al-Qud\u016bm.\nIt also indicates that if a person assumes Ihr\u0101m for Hajj only, there is nothing wrong with him performing Taw\u0101f around the House.\nThe Had\u012bth points out that one of the etiquettes that a questioner should observe is to pose his question by himself, if possible.."}, {"number": 422, "hadith": "Asm\u0101\u2019 bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her) reported:  As we set out in Ihr\u0101m, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Whoever has Hady should remain in Ihr\u0101m, and whoever does not have Hady should end Ihr\u0101m.\" I did not have Hady, and so I ended Ihr\u0101m. Az-Zubayr had Hady, and so he did not end Ihr\u0101m. She said: I wore my clothes and went out and sat beside Az-Zubayr. Thereupon, he said: \"Stay away from me.\" I said: \"Do you fear that I would jump on you?!\".", "commentary": "Tamattu\u2018 in Hajj is when a pilgrim intends to perform \u2018Umrah along with Hajj. As he comes to Makkah and performs \u2018Umrah, he ends his Ihr\u0101m and enjoys all that is lawful till the beginning of the rituals of Hajj on the 8th day of Dhul-Hijjah.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Asm\u0101\u2019 bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her) mentions part of what happened during the Farewell Hajj. She informs that they set out in Ihr\u0101m for Hajj during the tenth Hijri year. When the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) reached Makkah, performed Taw\u0101f around the House, and made Sa\u2018i between Safa and Marwah, he enjoined his Companions who had Hady - a name for the livestock, camels, cows, and sheep offered to the Ka\u2018bah as an act of worship to Allah - to remain in Ihr\u0101m till they would end it after standing at \u2018Arafah and complete the rituals of Hajj; thus, they performed Hajj of Qir\u0101n, performing Hajj and \u2018Umrah together. As for those who did not have Hady with them, they should perform \u2018Umrah and end Ihr\u0101m and then wait in Tamattu\u2018 till the day of Tarwiyah, the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah, on which they would assume Ihr\u0101m for Hajj; thus, they performed Hajj of Tamattu\u2018.\nAsm\u0101\u2019 (may Allah be pleased with her) related that she was among those who did not have Hady, so they performed \u2018Umrah with Tamattu\u2018. Meanwhile, her husband Az-Zubayr ibn al-\u2018Aww\u0101m (may Allah be pleased with him) was one of those who brought the Hady, and so he remained in Ihr\u0101m. After she ended her Ihr\u0101m, she put on her clothes. This probably refers to her adorned clothes, for women are not forbidden from wearing stitched clothes under Ihr\u0101m. The version narrated by An-Nas\u0101\u2019i supports this: \"and I put on some of my perfume.\" So, she (may Allah be pleased with her) went out of her tent and sat beside her husband, Az-Zubayr ibn al-\u2018Aww\u0101m (may Allah be pleased with him). Thereupon, he asked her to get up and stay away from him. In a version by Muslim: \"Keep away from me, keep away from me.\" He (may Allah be pleased with him) seemingly feared he might do something forbidden for a Muhrim, such as touching a woman with desire and the like. Expressing disapproval of him, she (may Allah be pleased with her) said: \"Do you fear that I would jump on you?!\" i.e., that I will attack you and throw myself over you?! She meant: Do not think that I have come to spoil your Hajj or that she would cause him to engage in some of the things forbidden under Ihr\u0101m.\nThe Had\u012bth demonstrates the legitimacy of performing \u2018Umrah with Tamattu\u2018 during the months of Hajj.\nIt indicates that if a performer of Tamattu\u2018 Hajj does not bring the Hady with him and ends his Ihr\u0101m after performing \u2018Umrah, all the things forbidden for him under Ihr\u0101m become permissible for him till he assumes Ihr\u0101m for Hajj.."}, {"number": 423, "hadith": "Muslim al-Qurri reported:  I asked Ibn' Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) about the Mut'ah of Hajj, and he declared it permissible, whereas Ibn Az-Zubayr forbade it.

So, if he comes to Makkah during the months of Hajj and performs \u2018Umrah, he may end his Ihr\u0101m and enjoy all that is lawful until the rituals of Hajj begin.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Muslim ibn Mikhr\u0101q al-Qurri informs that he asked \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) about the Tamattu\u2018 in \u2018Umrah till the coming of Hajj, and he declared it permissible, i.e., it is legitimate and permissible. \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn Az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with him) forbade Tamattu\u2018. This is a difference of opinion between them based on the different reports reaching each of them about the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"This is the mother of Ibn Az-Zubayr\" - meaning Asm\u0101\u2019 bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her) - \"narrating that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) declared it permissible\"; and he enjoined them to visit her and ask her about the ruling on the Mut\u2018ah of Hajj. Muslim ibn Mikhr\u0101q al-Qurri informed that when they entered her place, they found her to be a blind bulky woman, i.e., a big woman; and she became blind toward the end of her life. She told them that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) declared it - i.e., the Mut\u2018ah of Hajj - permissible. This is the same view held by Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him).\nShu\u2018bah ibn al-Hajj\u0101j - one of the Had\u012bth narrators - related that Muslim al-Qurri, in one of his versions, said: \"I do not know whether it is the Mut\u2018ah of Hajj or the Mut\u2018ah of women\" i.e., he means the Mut\u2018ah mentioned in the Had\u012bth, whether it refers to the Mut\u2018ah of Hajj or the Mut\u2018ah of women. The mentioned Mut\u2018ah which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) declared permissible is more likely to be the Mut\u2018ah of Hajj, for it is mentioned in the narration of Rawh ibn \u2018Ub\u0101dah from Shu\u2018bah, who memorized Had\u012bths better than others. The Mut\u2018ah marriage is to marry a woman for a specified period, using the word Tamattu\u2018, in return for a sum of money. This kind of marriage was permissible at the beginning. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade it ever since the Battle of Khaybar till the Day of Judgment.."}, {"number": 424, "hadith": "Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) proclaimed Talbiyah for Hajj. [In a version]: We set out with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) proclaiming Talbiyah for Hajj. In all their versions: He performed the morning prayer in Al-Bat'h\u0101\u2019 - except for Al-Jahdami, who did not make mention of it..", "commentary": "Hajj is the fifth pillars of Islam, and it is an act of worship for those who can find a way to it. All its rituals must be taken from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). The Prophet's Companions were keen to convey that to the T\u0101bi\u2018is.\nThis Had\u012bth is an abridged version of another Had\u012bth narrated by Muslim, in which \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: \"The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) proclaimed Talbiyah for Hajj\" i.e., he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went out of Mad\u012bnah intending to perform Hajj. So, he assumed Ihr\u0101m for Hajj and raised his voice in saying Talbiyah. His assumption of Ihr\u0101m and proclamation of Talbiyah took place in Dhul-Hulayfah, which is known today as \"\u0100b\u0101r \u2018Ali\". He arrived in Makkah as four nights of Dhul-Hijjah had passed, in the tenth Hijri year. He performed the Fajr prayer at Al-Bat'h\u0101\u2019 on the morning of the fourth day of Dhul-Hijjah. Al-Bat'h\u0101\u2019: a place outside Makkah, and it is a broad channel containing small pebbles. It is also called Al-Muhassab. When he performed the Fajr prayer, he enjoined them to dissolve their Ihr\u0101m of Hajj and turn it into \u2018Umrah. This is because during J\u0101hiliyyah \"they used to consider the performance of \u2018Umrah during the months of Hajj to be one of the worst immoralities in the world.\" Narrated by Al-Bukh\u0101ri and Muslim. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) wanted to forbid them from that and demonstrate the lawfulness of doing so, and that whoever wants to perform \u2018Umrah during the months of Hajj may perform it, and there is nothing wrong with that, and he becomes a performer of Tamattu\u2018 Hajj. When a person comes to Makkah during the months of Hajj and performs \u2018Umrah, he may end his Ihr\u0101m and enjoy all the lawful things till the beginning of the Hajj rituals, and then he assumes Ihr\u0101m for Hajj.\nIt is said: He enjoined those who did not have the Hady to do that. As for those who brought the Hady, they should remain in their Ihr\u0101m for Hajj and not end it, for the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Had I not had the Hady with me, I would have ended my Ihr\u0101m.\" Narrated by Al-Bukh\u0101ri and Muslim.."}, {"number": 425, "hadith": "Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"This is an \u2018Umrah which we have treated as Tamattu\u2018. So, whoever does not have the sacrificial animals should end Ihr\u0101m completely, for \u2018Umrah has been incorporated in Hajj until the Day of Judgment.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went out for Hajj in the tenth year, in Dhul-Hijjah. It was called the Farewell Hajj. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanded some of his Companions, after they had come to Makkah and performed Taw\u0101f around the House and Sa\u2018i between Safa and Marwah, to end their Hajj and turn it into \u2018Umrah, which was called Tamattu\u2018 in performing \u2018Umrah before Hajj.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) mentions that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"This is an \u2018Umrah which we have treated as Tamattu\u2018\"; thereby, he refers to the command he gave to some of his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) to end their Hajj and turn it into \u2018Umrah. Meanwhile, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was in a state of Qir\u0101n, performing \u2018Umrah along with Hajj, and he did not end his Hajj to turn it into \u2018Umrah along with them. However, he attributed Tamattu\u2018 to himself because he was the one who commanded them to do so and approved it for them. Those who were commanded to engage in Tamattu\u2018 were those who did not have the sacrificial animals, a term that refers to cattle, such as camels, cows, and sheep, that are offered at the Ka\u2018bah as a means of closeness to Allah. He (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ordered them to end Ihr\u0101m completely, i.e., all the things forbidden because of Ihr\u0101m were then permissible for them. Then, clarifying the reason behind his command about ending Ihr\u0101m, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said that \u2018Umrah was incorporated into Hajj until the Day of Judgment, i.e., \u2018Umrah can be performed in the months of Hajj, unlike the past practice of the people of J\u0101hiliyyah. The intention for \u2018Umrah was incorporated into the intention for Hajj, such that if a person intends to perform Hajj, it becomes legitimate for him to end Hajj by the performance of \u2018Umrah, in case he did not bring the sacrificial animals with him. As for those who bring the sacrificial animals with them, they should remain in their Ihr\u0101m until the completion of the rituals of Hajj, and this is called Qir\u0101n Hajj.\nThe Had\u012bth shows that \u2018Umrah can be performed in the months of Hajj.."}, {"number": 426, "hadith": "Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) performed the Zuhr prayer in Dhul-Hulayfah. Then, he called for his she-camel and marked it on the right side of its hump, removed the blood from it, and tied two of its shoes around its neck. Then, he mounted his riding camel, and when it brought him up to Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019, he pronounced Talbiya for Hajj. [In a version]: When the Prophet of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came to Dhu al-Hulayfah. He did not say: He offered the Zhuhr prayer therein..", "commentary": "Hajj is one of the pillars of Islam which Allah Almighty commanded His servants to fulfill. It must be performed by him who can, physically and financially. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) performed Hajj only once. So, the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) transmitted the detailed aspects of this Hajj, so that we can learn the manner of Hajj enjoined by Allah Almighty.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) says that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) performed the Zhuhr prayer while going out to Hajj in Dhul-Hulayfah in a shortened form, i.e., as two Rak\u2018ahs. This is because he was traveling to Makkah, and Dhul-Hulayfah is close, located 6 or 7 miles (nearly 10km) away from Mad\u012bnah and 420km from Makkah. It is nowadays known among ordinary people as Abiy\u0101r \u2018Ali or \u0100b\u0101r \u2018Ali,  and it is the Miq\u0101t for the people of Mad\u012bnah and those who pass by it. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) called for \"his she-camel,\" which was part of the sacrificial animals to be slaughtered in the Sacred Precincts. \"And marked it on the right side of its hump,\" the highest area on the back of the camel. Marking a sacrificial camel is to slit one side of its hump until it bleeds. This is used as a mark indicating that the camel is a sacrifice; thus, no one will take it. And if it strays away, it will be brought back, and if it gets mixed up with other camels, it remains distinct. \"Removed the blood from it and tied two shoes around its neck\" to be another mark defining it as a sacrifice. \"Then, he mounted his riding animal,\" which is a mount prepared for traveling. At that time, it was a she-camel called Al-Qasw\u0101\u2019. \"And when it brought him up,\" i.e., the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ascended while on the back of the riding animal to an area called 'Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019'', a place adjacent to Dhul-Hulayfah, the location of Miq\u0101t for the people of Mad\u012bnah. Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019 in the Arabic language means the empty desert. But here it refers to a certain place between Makkah and Mad\u012bnah, and it is located above the two signposts of Dhul-Hulayfah for those who ascend from the valley. At the beginning of Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019 lies a well of water.\nWhen the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was in Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019, he pronounced Talbiyah for Hajj, i.e., he assumed Ihr\u0101m for Hajj and raised his voice in proclaiming the Talbiyah of Hajj.\nIn a Had\u012bth of the Two Sah\u012bh Collections, \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not pronounce Talbiyah except from the mosque, meaning the mosque of Dhul-Hulayfah.\" The difference between the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) regarding the locations from which the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) proclaimed Talbiyah is probably because each of them talked about what he saw. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went out from Mad\u012bnah for Hajj, and when he prayed in the mosque of Dhul-Hulayfah, he pronounced Talbiyah for Hajj. So, some people heard that from him and memorized it. Then, he rode, and when his she-camel stood up with him on its back, he proclaimed Talbiyah. Some people became aware of his act, as they would come in groups. They heard it and said: Indeed, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) pronounced Talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back. Then, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) proceeded, and when he ascended the height of Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019, he pronounced Talbiyah. Some people became aware of what he did, and so they said: Indeed, he pronounced Talbiyah when he ascended the height of Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019. So, each of them transmitted what he heard. This clearly indicates that the difference arose over starting the proclamation of Talbiyah and the assumption of Ihr\u0101m from the Miq\u0101t. This confusion is cleared by the Had\u012bth narrated by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd, in which Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"I swear by Allah, he proclaimed Talbiyah at the place where he prayed, and he proclaimed Talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back, and he proclaimed Talbiyah when he ascended the height of Al-Bayd\u0101\u2019.\"\nThe Had\u012bth points out what the pilgrim should do if he brings the sacrificial animal with him, marking it, causing some of its blood to flow, and hanging a sign around its neck.\nIt also indicates that Talbiyah and Ihr\u0101m should be proclaimed at the locational Miq\u0101t.."}, {"number": 427, "hadith": "Abu Hass\u0101n al-A\u2018raj reported:  A man from Banu al-Hujaym said to Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s: \"What is this Fatwa of yours which has engaged the attention of people, or has become a matter of dispute among them - that he who performs Taw\u0101f around the House has ended his Ihr\u0101m?!\" He said: \"The Sunnah of your Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), even if you dislike it.\".", "commentary": "Tamattu\u2018 in Hajj is when the pilgrim assumes Ihr\u0101m for \u2018Umrah during the days of Hajj and then ends his Ihr\u0101m, after which he assumes Ihr\u0101m for Hajj in the same year. So, if he comes to Makkah during the months of Hajj and performs \u2018Umrah, he may end his Ihr\u0101m and enjoy all that is lawful until the rituals of Hajj begin.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Abu Hass\u0101n al-A\u2018raj informs that a man from Banu al-Hujaym - a branch of the tribe of Tam\u012bm - said to \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him): \"What is this Fatwa of yours which has engaged people's attention or has become a matter of dispute among them.\" In Arabic, Tashaghghafat means: It gripped people's attention; and Tashaghghabat: It made them confused regarding their matter. The Fatwa is that he who performs Taw\u0101f around the House has ended his Ihr\u0101m. It apparently suggests that he (may Allah be pleased with him) advocated Tamattu\u2018 in Hajj, whereas \u2018Umar and \u2018Uthm\u0101n (may Allah be pleased with both of them), during their respective caliphates, and some of the Companions forbade it and enjoined people to perform Hajj of Ifr\u0101d. So, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) clarified to them that he who performs Taw\u0101f around the House and makes Sa\u2018i between Safa and Marwah has ended his Ihr\u0101m by shaving his head or cutting his hair and dissolved his Hajj and turned it into \u2018Umrah, in case he has not brought the Hady with him; as for he who brought the Hady, he should continue his Ihr\u0101m until he completes the other rituals of Hajj. His words: \"The Sunnah of your Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him)\" mean: What Ibn' Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) urged them to do is what the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) determined for his Companions in the Farewell Hajj, and it continued to be done after him, and it was not mentioned therein that the ruling was abrogated or that it particularly applied to them at that time. It is well known that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanded them to end their Ihr\u0101m by Taw\u0101f and Sa'i and shaving or cutting hair. This happened at the top of Marwah, as stated in the Had\u012bth reported by J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) and narrated by Muslim. And his words: \"even if you dislike it\" mean: You obey and comply even if you are unwilling.\nSome took the words of Ibn' Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) here to mean that one should end Ihr\u0101m after Taw\u0101f al-Qud\u016bm.

To proclaim Talbiyah is to say it in a loud voice. This indicates that he will set out for Hajj to the House of Allah Almighty, which will come to pass in the valley of Ar-Rawh\u0101\u2019, a place lying between Makkah and Mad\u012bnah.

He told him why he rode the she-camel, and that was because the people \"were neither pushed aside from him nor were they turned away.\" In some versions: \"they were not forced\", i.e., no one would force them to turn away from him.\nAnother version by Muslim points out that riding is not an act of Sunnah, and that walking and Ramal between Safa and Marwah was more beloved to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).

First: The Black Corner. He used to kiss or point to it with a stick or the like and then kiss it.

In a Had\u012bth in the Sah\u012bh Muslim Collection, Abu At-Tufayl (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: \"and he kissed the curved-end stick.\" This is because one of the Sunnahs of Taw\u0101f is to kiss the Black Stone, and since he was unable to touch the Stone with his hand, he touched it with a stick and kissed what touched the Stone. Then, J\u0101bir (may Allah be pleased with him) pointed out that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) rode his she-camel to make it easier for people to see him and for him to be at a high place so that the people could recognize him and ask him about anything they would find confusing regarding the rituals of Hajj. He did so because the people \"crowded around him\"; so, he feared for them due to this crowdedness and did not want to be obliged to turn them away from himself. Therefore, his riding was easier for him and them and more beneficial in terms of following his example, and so that they could see him and ask him about whatever they wished.\nThe Had\u012bth denotes the permissibility to perform Taw\u0101f while riding a mount, and this also applies to similar things like wheelchairs, particularly if riding serves a certain benefit, such as giving Fatwas to people and teaching them.\nIt also mentions touching the Black Stone and indicates that if a person is unable to touch it with his hand - because he is riding something or there is crowdedness - he may touch it with a stick or the like.."}, {"number": 432, "hadith": "\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah reported:  The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) performed Taw\u0101f around the Ka\u2018bah during the Farewell Hajj on the back of his camel, and he touched the Corner (the Black Stone), disliking that the people should be pushed away from him..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to teach people through words and deeds, and he would facilitate the matters of religion for them at times of hardship and necessity. For example, he would facilitate the rituals and acts of Hajj that were hard for people.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), the Prophet's wife, informs that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) performed Taw\u0101f on the back of his camel, which was prepared for traveling, during the Farewell Hajj, that was the Hajj performed by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in 10 A.H. It was called as such because the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) seemed to have been bidding farewell to them, and he passed away shortly after that. \"and he touched the Corner\" i.e., the Black Stone. In the Two Sah\u012bh Collections: \"and he touched the Stone with a Mihjan\" i.e., a curved-end staff. In a Had\u012bth narrated by Muslim, Abu At-Tufayl (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: \"and he touched the curved-end staff.\" This is because one of the Sunnahs of Taw\u0101f is to kiss the Black Stone.\nClarifying the reason for that, she said: \"disliking that the people should be pushed away from him\", which means that if he performed Taw\u0101f on foot, it would be feared that people around him would be pushed away. So, out of compassion towards the people, he rode his camel to prevent that from happening. This was a method for turning them away from him without pushing, forcing, or shouting at them. Certainly, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would not accept that people be pushed away from him. But he rode his camel lest one of those around him would volunteer to push the people away from him. In a version by An-Nas\u0101\u2019i in As-Sunan Al-Kubra Collection - and also in some versions in the Sah\u012bh Muslim Collection -: \"the people be pushed away from him\"; \"pushed away\" instead of \"beaten\". The pronoun in Arabic may be referring to the Stone, and the meaning would be: If he performed Taw\u0101f on foot, the people would turn away from the Stone each time the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) passed by it, to avoid putting him in crowding, out of reverence for him. And the pronoun may be referring to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and the meaning would be: Anyone who tried to reach him to ask him, see him, or follow his example would be unable to do so because of the large crowds around him, and so he would turn away without having his need fulfilled.\nAlso one of the reasons behind his riding during Taw\u0101f was what J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) reported in a Had\u012bth narrated by Muslim: \"so that the people could see him, and he should be conspicuous, and they could ask him, for the people crowded around him,\", i.e. so that the people could recognize him and ask him about anything they found confusing regarding the rituals of Hajj. He rode his she-camel because the people crowded around him, so he feared this crowdedness for them and did not want to be obliged to turn them away from himself. Therefore, his riding was easier for him and them and more beneficial in terms of following his example.\nThe Had\u012bth denotes the permissibility to perform Taw\u0101f while riding a mount, and this also applies to similar things, like wheel wheelchairs, mainly if riding serves a particular benefit, such as giving Fatwas to people and teaching them.\nIt also mentions touching the Black Stone and indicates that if a person cannot touch it with his hand - because of riding something or crowdedness - he may touch it with a stick or the like.."}, {"number": 433, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h reported:  Neither the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) nor his Companions performed Taw\u0101f between Safa and Marwah except for one Taw\u0101f. [In a version]: Except for one Taw\u0101f; his first Taw\u0101f..", "commentary": "Hajj is one of the pillars of Islam, and it is an act of worship for those who can find a way to it. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) taught us its pillars, Sunnahs, and etiquettes.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the noble Companion J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h says that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), in his Hajj, did not perform Taw\u0101f between Safa and Marwah, except for one Taw\u0101f, neither did his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). Another version adds: \"his first Taw\u0101f\". Taw\u0101f here refers to Sa\u2018i between the mount of Safa and Marwah, which is one of the pillars of Hajj and \u2018Umrah. It consists of seven rounds, the first of which starts from Safa and ends at Marwah, and the second round starts from Marwah and ends at Safa, and so on. Those of his Companions who performed Qir\u0101n Hajj - combining Hajj and \u2018Umrah with one Ihr\u0101m - did not perform Sa\u2018i between Safa and Marwah except for once, because one Taw\u0101f and one Sa\u2018i is sufficient for the performer of Qir\u0101n Hajj, as the rituals of \u2018Umrah are incorporated into the rituals of Hajj. As for those who performed Tamattu\u2018 Hajj - assuming Ihr\u0101m for \u2018Umrah in the months of Hajj and then ending its Ihr\u0101m and assuming Ihr\u0101m for Hajj - they performed two Sa\u2018is: one Sa\u2018i for their \u2018Umrah and another Sa\u2018i for their Hajj on the Day of Nahr. This is demonstrated by a Had\u012bth narrated by Al-Bukh\u0101ri and Muslim, in which \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: \"Those who proclaimed Talbiyah for \u2018Umrah performed Taw\u0101f around the House and between Safa and Marwah. Then, they ended Ihr\u0101m, and then they performed another Taw\u0101f after returning from Mina,\" i.e., those who performed Tamattu\u2018 Hajj. \"As for those who combined Hajj and \u2018Umrah, they performed one Taw\u0101f,\" i.e., those who performed Qir\u0101n Hajj.."}, {"number": 434, "hadith": "Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s reported:  Al-Fadl ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s, who rode behind the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), reported that on the evening of \u2018Arafah and the morning of Jam\u2018, he said to the people when they returned: \"Adopt tranquility!\" Meanwhile, he held back his she-camel till he entered Muhassir, which is part of Mina, and said: \"Get the Khadhf pebbles whereby the Jamrah is thrown.\" [In a version]: He did not mention: And he added: As the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) pointed with his hand like a person engaging in Khadhf..", "commentary": "Tranquility and solemnity are among the commendable traits encouraged by the Shariah, especially in worship and such situations that entail displaying them more than any other time, like Hajj, given that there are plenty of people and crowdedness therein, which requires moderateness in walking to avoid hurting others.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Al-Fadl ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) mentions that he was riding behind the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) on his mount during the season of Hajj at the end of the day of \u2018Arafah, which is the ninth day of Dhul-Hijjah, at the time of heading to Muzdalifah, and \"on the evening of \u2018Arafah\"; it is said: It occurs after sunset, for this is the time of the Im\u0101m's departure and the time of breaking the fast. It is also said: It is the time of standing from the afternoon to the dawn of the day of Nahr, for this is a time in which people stand at \u2018Arafah and come to it in this manner. And it is said: The evening extends from noon to sunset. \u2018Arafah is a name for the well-known area where the pilgrims must stand on the ninth day of Dhul-Hijjah. Jam 'is Muzdalifah. It is a valley located between the two Mash\u0101\u2018ir of Mina and 'Araf\u0101t, and the pilgrims stay there after leaving 'Araf\u0101t, and then they perform therein the Maghrib and 'Ish\u0101' prayers, combined and shortened, and they collect from it the pebbles for throwing Jamar\u0101t at Mina. The pilgrims stay there till the morning of the next day, the day of Eid al-Ad'ha, after which they head to Mina.\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to the people: \"Adopt tranquility!\" This is a Prophetic instruction on etiquette and Sunnah related to departing from 'Arafah and Muzdalifah, which also applies to all crowded situations. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) prevented his she-camel from hastening amid crowds and made his mount move slowly. Thus, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) set a practical example of walking with calmness and tranquility and without hastening in crowdedness. He proceeded in this manner until he entered the valley of Muhassir, a small valley passing between and separating Mina and Muzdalifah.\nWhen the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) entered the valley of Muhassir, he instructed the people on the size of the pebbles they should collect; he said: \"Get the Khadhf pebbles\", and these are small pebbles similar to the seeds of beans. In another version: \"As the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) pointed with his hand like a person engaging in Khadhf.\" This is intended for clarification and greater demonstration of the size of the pebbles to be thrown at the Jamar\u0101t and that they should be small, like the Khadhf pebbles. It is not intended that the throwing should be in the manner of Khadhf, which is done with the tips of the forefinger and the thumb.\nThen, Al-Fadl (may Allah be pleased with him) informed: that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) kept proclaiming Talbiyah till he finished the throwing of Jamrat al-\u2018Aqabah on the day of Nahr, which is the tenth of Dhul-Hijjah. Thereupon, he stopped Talbiyah. This is the largest Jamrah, which lies to the west of Mina in the direction of Makkah. The wording of Talbiyah reads: \"Labbayka allahumma labbayk, labbayka la shar\u012bka laka labbayk, inna al-hamda wa an-ni\u2018mata laka wal-mulk, la shar\u012bka lak (Here I am at Your service, O Allah, here I am at Your service; here I am at Your service, You have no partner, here I am at Your service. Indeed, the praise, the favor, and the dominion belong to You. You have no partner).\" The time of Talbiyah begins upon the assumption of Ihr\u0101m for Hajj or \u2018Umrah.\nThe Had\u012bth demonstrates how the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would care about people and direct them in such situations where needed.\nIt indicates that the pebbles should be small and they should be thrown gently, so as not to hurt people with strong throwing or large pebbles.."}, {"number": 435, "hadith": "\u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n ibn Yaz\u012bd reported:  that \u2018Abdull\u0101h proclaimed Talbiyah when he departed from Jam\u2018.

It is the third among the sacred Mash\u0101\u2018ir by which the pilgrims pass and is located between Mina and \u2018Araf\u0101t.

Indeed, the praise, the favor, and the dominion belong to You. You have no partner).\" When the people heard him proclaiming Talbiyah in this place and at this time, they expressed disapproval of his Talbiyah and thought that he was a Bedouin from the dwellers of the desert who had no understanding or knowledge about the rulings of the religion. Al-Bayhaqi narrated in Al-Kubra Collection: \"They said: O Bedouin, this is not a day for Talbiyah; it is a day for Takb\u012br.\" Expressing disapproval of those who criticized his Talbiyah upon departing from Muzdalifah, \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn Mas\u2018\u016bd (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"Have people forgotten or gone astray?!\" In other words, have those people forgotten the Prophet's Sunnah in Talbiyah in a situation like this and therefore they criticized it, or they have knowingly abandoned the Sunnah?! Then, He said: \"I heard the one to whom Surat al-Baqarah was revealed\" - meaning the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) - \"say in this place: Labbayka allahumma labbayk (Here I am at Your service, O Allah, here I am at Your service)\" i.e., I repeat my response to You in complying with Your command to perform Hajj, and I observe Your command time and again. He mentioned Surat al-Baqarah in particular because most of the rulings on the rituals occur therein. So, it is as if he said: This is the practice of the one to whom the rituals were revealed, from whom the Shariah was taken, and who clarified the rulings; so, adopt it.\nThe Had\u012bth mentions that Talbiyah is to be proclaimed in Muzdalifah.\nIt shows how the Companions used to teach people and remind them of the Sunnah of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).."}, {"number": 436, "hadith": "\u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Umar reported:  We were with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in the morning of \u2018Arafah, and some of us were saying Takb\u012br and some of us were saying Ihl\u0101l (Talbiyah).

The most important ritual of Hajj is performed in \u2018Arafah, which is standing at \u2018Arafah on the ninth day of Dhul-Hijjah. Some of the people with the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) were \"saying Takb\u012br\" i.e., saying: Allahu akbar (Allah is the Greatest), and some of them were \"saying Ihl\u0101l\" i.e., proclaiming Talbiyah, as in another version by Muslim. Ihl\u0101l is to raise one's voice with Talbiyah. This indicates that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) approved their Dhikr, be it Takb\u012br or Talbiyah. And it is said: The intended meaning is that he would incorporate some Dhikr into Talbiyah, not that he abandoned Talbiyah altogether, as it is reported that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not cease Talbiyah till he threw Jamrat al-\u2018Aqabah.\nIbn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"As for us, we were saying Takb\u012br\" i.e., he (may Allah be pleased with him) and those with him chose to say Takb\u012br in this Hajj of theirs.\nThen, \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn Abi Salamah - one of the Had\u012bth narrators - said to \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Umar: \"By Allah, your affair is strange!

By this, 'Abdull\u0101h ibn Abi Salamah wanted to know what is best, for the Had\u012bth includes Takb\u012br and Talbiyah.

Then, they would head to Mina before the Im\u0101m stood at Al-Mash\u2018ar al-Har\u0101m and before he left for Mina. Some of them reached Mina at the time of the Fajr prayer, and so they threw Jamrat al-\u2018Aqabah, and some others arrived at Mina after that time, and they threw Jamrat al-\u2018Aqabah, which is the largest Jamrah.\nJam\u2018a is Muzdalifah, and it is the third among the sacred Mash\u0101\u2018ir by which the pilgrims pass and is located between Mina and \u2018Araf\u0101t. The pilgrims stay there after leaving \u2018Araf\u0101t at the end of the ninth day of Dhul-Hijjah, and then they perform therein the Maghrib and \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayers, combined and shortened, and they collect therein pebbles for throwing Jamar\u0101t at Mina. The pilgrims stay there till the morning of the following day, the day of Eid al-Ad'ha, after which they head to Mina.\nIbn Jurayj asked his Shaykh \u2018At\u0101\u2019 ibn Abi Rab\u0101h: Were you informed that Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"He had sent me in the latter part of the night\"? He replied: No! Rather, he said: \"at the time of Sahar\" i.e., without specifying a certain hour. So, Ibn Jurayj asked him: Did Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s say: We threw the Jamrah before dawn, and where did he perform the Fajr prayer? He replied: No! He did not mention to me when he threw the Jamrah or where he prayed. He did not tell me anything beyond what I have mentioned to you.\nThe Had\u012bth shows how Islam facilitates things for the weak people during Hajj and allows them to throw the Jamrah before dawn before people come in crowds.\nIt demonstrates the integrity in transmitting the Sunnah and traditions from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and from the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them).."}, {"number": 440, "hadith": "J\u0101bir reported:  I saw the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) throwing pebbles while riding his mount on the day of Nahr, and he was saying: \"Learn your rituals, for I do not know whether I will be performing Hajj after this Hajj of mine.\".", "commentary": "The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) were keen to follow the Prophet's example in everything, especially the acts of worship, including the obligation of Hajj, whose pillars, Sunnahs, and etiquettes must be taken from the Prophet's guidance, which clarifies in detail what the Qur'an mentions in brief terms.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the noble Companion J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him) informs that he saw the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) during the Farewell Hajj - which was in the tenth Hijri year - throwing Jamrat al-\u2018Aqabah while riding his mount - his she-camel which he used for traveling - during the day of Nahr, i.e., his throwing of Jamrah during the day of Eid, on the tenth day of Dhul-Hijjah, and that he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) threw the Jamrah while riding so as to display his act to the people. He was saying to the people: \"Learn your rituals,\" i.e., learn from me and memorize the rulings I practised during my Hajj through words and deeds. Take them from me, apply them, and teach them to others. Clarifying the reason for that, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"for I do not know whether I will be performing Hajj after this Hajj of mine.\" This was a signal for bidding farewell to them, informing them about his imminent death, urging them to be keen on learning from him and seizing the opportunity of accompanying him and learning the matters of the religion. Hence, this was called the Farewell Hajj.\nThe Had\u012bth mentions that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) enjoined his Ummah to learn the matters of the religion, especially the rituals, from him, and not to act according to their personal whims; rather, they should follow the Sunnah he laid down for them.."}, {"number": 441, "hadith": "\u2019Umm Al-Husayn reported:  I performed the Farewell Hajj along with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and saw him when he threw Jamrat al-\u2018Aqabah and returned while he was riding the mount, and Bil\u0101l and Us\u0101mah were with him.

It was called as such because the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) seemed to have been bidding farewell to the Companions, and he passed away shortly thereafter. It took place during the tenth Hijri year.

Khadhf: throwing a pebble or a stone or holding it between one's forefingers and throwing it. This is meant to demonstrate the size of the thrown pebbles in terms of smallness and largeness. So, the pebbles the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) threw were larger than chickpeas and smaller than hazelnuts. This denotes the prohibition of exaggeration in religion, like the belief that throwing large stones is more profound than throwing small ones. The throwing comprises seven pebbles each time, and they should be separated and thrown one after the other.\nThe Had\u012bth shows the facilitation of Islam in throwing the Jamar\u0101t, and that the stones should be small to avoid causing harm to the people during the rituals.."}, {"number": 443, "hadith": "J\u0101bir reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) threw pebbles at the Jamrah (stoning pillar) on the Day of Nahr (10th of Dhul-Hijjah) at Duha (forenoon), but threw after that when the sun passed its zenith..", "commentary": "Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam.

If cleaning is not done three times, he must do it more times until it is achieved. But if it is achieved by an odd number, there should be no more times. And if it is done an even number of times, he should wipe it one more time to make it odd. Likewise, throwing the Jamar\u0101t in Hajj should be done with seven pebbles, which is an odd number.

It has been established that some of the Companions used to take the Prophet's sweat and add it to their perfume. Others used to seek  the traces of his fingers on the food to eat from where he ate, and others used to drink from the leftovers of his drink. All this went along with their compliance with the Sunnah, their following of the Prophet's guidance out of love for the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and out of seeking blessings from his honorable traces.

It is said: It is the place of throwing the Jamar\u0101t at Mina, and it used to be called Khayf Bani Kin\u0101nah. Khayf: The place that goes down from the mountain and rises above the valley. It is located outside Makkah from the direction of Mad\u012bnah.\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) stopped there after the end of the days of throwing the Jamar\u0101t, and R\u0101fi\u2018, his freed slave (may Allah be pleased with him), had set up a tent for him in this place. After that, Abu Bakr and 'Umar followed the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in that, and they would stop in this place at the same time and some of the Companions, like 'Abdull\u0101h ibn' Umar, considered it to be one of the Sunnahs of Hajj, as narrated in the Sah\u012bh Muslim Collection.\n\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) stated that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) stopped at this place because this was easier for his departure to Mad\u012bnah and so that his Companions and those who would leave with him could gather there, as narrated in a version by Muslim, in which \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported: \"that she would not do that, and she said: Indeed, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) alighted there because it was an easier place for his departure.\"\nThe Had\u012bth shows how the Companions - such as Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with both of them) - would pursue the Prophet's guidance and were keen to follow his Sunnah.."}, {"number": 450, "hadith": "Abu R\u0101fi\u2018 reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not command me to stop at Al-Abtah when he departed from Mina, but I came and set up his canvas therein, and he came and alighted.

The Prophet's actions during his Hajj were Sunnah and guidance for those who came after him. The Companions were keen to follow the Prophet's guidance and act like him, and they were also keen to demonstrate what is part of the Sunnah and what is not part of the Sunnah, yet it was accidentally done by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\nIn this Had\u012bth, the noble Companion Abu R\u0101fi\u2018 (may Allah be pleased with him) - the Prophet's freed slave and servant - \"and he was in charge of the Prophet's belongings\" i.e., he was responsible for the Prophet's personal items; he informs that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not enjoin him when he departed from Mina, to stop at Al-Abtah, which means a spacious place, and it here refers to a location between Mina and Makkah. It is also called Al-Muhassab and Khayf Bani Kin\u0101nah. Al-Abtah today comprises buildings and markets. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) departed from Mina after throwing the pebbles on the 13th day of Dhul-Hijjah, following the completion of the Hajj rituals.\nAbu R\u0101fi\u2018 (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"but I came and set up his canvas therein.\" Canvas is a tent made of wool or other material. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came, alighted, and rested in this tent set up at Al-Abtah - and this happened before the Farewell Taw\u0101f. In a Had\u012bth in the Sah\u012bh Al-Bukh\u0101ri Collection, Anas ibn M\u0101lik reported: \"that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) performed the Zhuhr, \u2018Asr, Maghrib, and \u2018Ish\u0101\u2019 prayers and then had a sleep in Al-Muhassab, after which he rode toward the House and performed Taw\u0101f around it.\"\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) alighted in this place after completing the Hajj rituals, for it was easier for his departure to Madinah and so that his Companions and those who would leave with him could gather there, as narrated in a version by Muslim, in which \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported: \"Indeed, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) alighted there because this place was easier for his departure.\"."}, {"number": 451, "hadith": "Bakr ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h al-Muzani reported:  While I was sitting with Ibn' Abb\u0101s near the Ka'bah, a Bedouin came to him and said: \"What is the matter that I see that the children of your uncle supply honey and milk, whereas you supply Nab\u012bdh (water sweetened with dates or raisins)?! Is it due to your poverty or due to your stinginess?\" Thereupon, Ibn' Abb\u0101s said: \"Praise be to Allah, we are neither poor nor stingy. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came riding his mount, and Us\u0101mah was sitting behind him. He asked for water, and we gave him a cup of Nab\u012bdh, and he drank and gave the remaining amount to Us\u0101mah, and he said: 'You have done something good and pleasant. Continue doing it.' So, we do not want to change what the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanded.\".", "commentary": "A true Muslim follows in the footsteps of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and adheres to his guidance, especially concerning what is authentically reported from him. This was the attitude of the Prophet's Companions, who were keen to follow the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in all his actions and statements.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Bakr ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h al-Muzani informs that while he was sitting with Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s near the Ka\u2018bah, a Bedouin - a dweller of the desert - came to him and said: \"What is the matter that I see that the children of your uncle\", meaning the rest of the Quraysh tribe apart from the children of Al-\u2018Abb\u0101s. \"supply honey and milk, whereas you supply Nab\u012bdh?!\" The Bedouin was referring to supplying water to the pilgrims. The children of Al-\u2018Abb\u0101s would provide the people with Nab\u012bdh, dates or raisins soaked in water till their taste became sweet. It is not intoxicating. Water in Makkah was subject to change, and so they used to sweeten it by that. He asked him: Is your abandonment of the supply of honey and milk due to poverty or stinginess? Thereupon, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"Praise be to Allah\", and he told him that they were neither poor nor stingy; instead, they did so in adherence to the teaching they had received from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). This is because the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had come to Makkah while riding his mount, i.e., his she-camel, and Us\u0101mah ibn Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him) was riding behind him. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked for water, and they brought him a vessel containing Nab\u012bdh, and he drank and made Us\u0101mah drink the amount left over. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to them: \"You have done something good and pleasant,\" i.e., you have done a good and pleasant act by sweetening water with Nab\u012bd made of dates or raisins. This indicates that this drink is not prohibited; otherwise, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would not have drunk it, and he would have forbidden it.\nThen, clarifying the reason for that, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"So, we do not want to change what the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanded\" about sweetening water with Nab\u012bdh, when he said: \"Continue doing it,\" i.e., the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade them to continue supplying Nab\u012bdh to the people, and they complied with his command. The meaning: We do not change the supply of Nab\u012bdh into the supply of something else like honey and milk, even if this is deemed more appropriate to people, but we will not change something which the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) liked and then commanded us to do. Indeed, this is more appropriate and befitting for us.\nThe Had\u012bth shows how the Companions followed the Prophet's guidance and were keen to adhere to his Sunnah.\nIt points out the merit of supplying drinks to the pilgrims.\nIt indicates that it is legitimate to drink non-intoxicating Nab\u012bdh.\nIt includes praise for those who supply drinks to the pilgrims and for every doer of good.\nThe Had\u012bth demonstrates that wealthy people may consume the water provided in the mosques or roads, for it is supplied for everyone, not the poor alone.."}, {"number": 452, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h reported:  We joined the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in Hajj and \u2018Umrah, and seven persons shared in a Badanah.

Badanah: It particularly belongs to camels. And it is said: It refers to camels and cows. In another version by Muslim: \"in camels and cows, and every seven persons of us shared in a Badanah.\" This means that if the Hady is a camel or a cow, it is valid and sufficient to be shared by seven persons.\nA man said to J\u0101bir: \"Can a Badanah be shared as a Jaz\u016br is shared? Jaz\u016br: young camels.

Hence, the man asked about it and whether it is valid to also share in it?

Badanah in Arabic and the plural is Budn, refers to a camel or cow brought and presented to the Sacred House of Allah. \"The camel stopped in the way, being completely exhausted,\" i.e., it fell due to exhaustion before reaching where it would be slaughtered.

In response, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Slaughter them\", i.e., slaughter them in the place where you would leave them, and then dye the hooves hung around their necks in their blood, and then put the blood \"on the sides of their humps\" so that they could be recognized by anyone passing them by after that and known to be Hady that have been spoiled, and thus he could eat from them freely and would not think them to be dead animals. This is because the routes people took on their journeys were well-known to everyone. Also, it was a common habit for the dwellers of the desert - the Bedouins - and others to follow the positions of the pilgrims to pick up whatever they left behind in the places of their rest.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: \"Neither you nor anyone of those in your company may eat from it\", i.e., your companions who travel with you.

Thus, whoever comes after them will look at it and realize that it is a damaged Hady and that it is permissible to eat from it without thinking it to be a dead animal.

They are reconciled by giving precedence to the Had\u012bth reported by 'Abdull\u0101h ibn' Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), as Bil\u0101l (may Allah be pleased with him) was with the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) inside the Ka'bah; or that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) entered the Ka'bah twice; he prayed at one time and did not pray at the other.."}, {"number": 459, "hadith": "\u2018At\u0101\u2019 reported:  When the House (the Ka\u2018bah) was burned during the time of Yaz\u012bd ibn Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah as the people of the Levant invaded it, and what happened to it happened, Ibn az-Zubayr left it until the people came to the season, seeking to encourage - or incite - them against the people of the Levant. When the people departed, he said: \"O people, advise me regarding the Ka'bah. Should I demolish it and then rebuild it or repair its damaged part?\" Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s said: \"An opinion has occurred to me concerning it; that you repair the damaged part of it and leave a House upon which the people embraced Islam and stones upon which the people embraced Islam and upon which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was sent.\" In reply, Ibn az-Zubayr said: \"If the house of one of you was burned, he would not be pleased until he renewed it. So, what about the House of your Lord? I will make Istikh\u0101rah (consult my Lord) for three and then determine my affair.\" When the three were over, he decided to demolish it. The people kept away from him, fearing that something from heaven might descend upon the first one to climb it. Then, a man climbed and threw down some stones from it. When the people saw that nothing harmed him, they went one after another and demolished it to the ground. Ibn Az-Zubayr erected pillars and hung curtains on them until its structure rose up. Ibn az-Zubayr also said: I heard \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah say: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Were it not for the fact that the people have recently left Kufr (disbelief) and that I do not have enough funds to enable me to build it, I would incorporate five cubits from the Hijr into it and make for it a door through which people enter and a door through which they exit.\" He said: \"Today, I have the funds, and I do not fear people.\" He said: \"He added to it five cubits from the Hijr till there appeared a foundation the people could see it. He built the structure upon it. The length of the Ka\u2018bah was 18 cubits, and when he added to it, he regarded it as short. So, he increased its length by ten cubits and made two doors for it: one for entrance and the other for exit. When Ibn az-Zubayr was killed, Al-Hajj\u0101j sent a message to \u2018Abdul-Malik ibn Marw\u0101n informing him about that and telling him that Ibn az-Zubayr had placed the structure upon a foundation that was seen by the upright people in Makkah. In reply, \u2018Abdul-Malik sent a message to him saying: \"We do not have anything to do with Ibn Zubayr's smearing. As for the addition he had made to its length, approve it. As for the addition he had made to it from the Hijr, revert it to its structure and wall up the door he had opened.\" So, he demolished it and restored it to its structure..", "commentary": "The Ka\u2018bah is the Sacred House of Allah and the Qiblah of the Muslims. It is the first house to be appointed for humankind. Abraham and Ishmael (Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl) (peace be upon both of them) had constructed it at the command of Allah Almighty, and it was demolished and built more than once.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018At\u0101\u2019 ibn Abu Rab\u0101h relates that when the Sacred House was burned, which happened when Al-Husayn ibn Numayr as-Sak\u016bni surrounded \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with him) in Makkah after the incident of Al-Harrah in Mad\u012bnah, in 63 A.H., at the command of Yaz\u012bd ibn Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah, the then Caliph of the Levant. Ibn Az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with him) was in dispute with him over the caliphate at the time. So, the people of the Levant entered the Sacred House to fight \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn az-Zubayr and the Ka\u2018bah was burned, and its wall inclined due to the throwing of a catapult, a tool that throws stones. This burning and damage that happened to the Ka\u2018bah were not intended to occur to it; rather, the intended purpose was to besiege Ibn Az-Zubayr. So, the catapult strikes were targeting him, not the Ka\u2018bah.\nDuring the siege, there came news about the death of Yaz\u012bd ibn Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah in 64 A.H. Thereupon, the Levant army returned to its land. Then Ibn Az-Zubayr rose and declared himself as the Caliph, and the pledge of allegiance was given to him as the Caliph, and he commanded the obedience of the people of the Hejaz, Egypt, Iraq, and Khur\u0101s\u0101n. After the departure of the Levant army, \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with him) left the House in its damaged state until people came from every place for the season of Hajj and gathered there. Ibn az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with him) wanted to \"embolden them\", i.e., encourage them to fight the people of the Levant, or \"incite them\", i.e., stir up rage in their hearts by making them see the burned House, and so they would fight the people of the Levant. When the people turned back to their homeland after the end of Hajj rituals, Ibn az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with him) said to the people of Makkah or the notables among them: \"O people, advise me regarding the Ka'bah\", i.e., give me your opinion: Should I demolish it and then rebuild it anew, or repair its weakened and damaged part? In reply, Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"An opinion has occurred to me concerning it\", i.e., an opinion has appeared and become clear to me, which is that you repair the weakened and damaged part in it and restore it to its former condition and leave the Ka'bah in the state which the people were familiar with when they embraced Islam. \"and stones upon which the people embraced Islam\", meaning the stones of the Ka'bah without alteration, and upon which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was sent, and he did not change them. Ibn az-Zubayr said: \"If the house of one of you was burned, he would not be pleased,\" i.e., the owner of the burned house until he renewed it. \"So, what about the House of your Lord?!\" In other words, the House of Allah Almighty is more worthy of being repaired and renovated. Then, he said to them: \"I am going to make Istikh\u0101rah (consult my Lord) for three\", i.e., I will perform the Istikh\u0101rah prayer and seek goodness and help from my Lord for three times or three days, and then I will make up my mind. When the three days were over, he realised that he should demolish and rebuild it, and he was determined to do that. As a result, the people avoided him. They turned away, fearing punishment would descend upon the first person to go above the House to demolish it, like what happened to the Companions of the Elephant. They remained in that situation till a man from them ascended the Ka\u2018bah and began to pull out the stones. When the people saw no punishment hit him, they moved and headed to the House one after another in constant succession. They demolished it and removed its stones until it was leveled to the ground. \"Ibn az-Zubayr erected pillars and hung curtains on them until its structure rose up.\" The purpose was to make these pillars and curtains a Qiblah for worshippers so that they could identify the location of the Ka'bah through them. These curtains remained till the structure went up and became visible to the people. At that point, he removed them, as the objective was achieved, which was to build the high structure of the Ka'bah.\nThen, Ibn az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with him) mentioned a Had\u012bth which he heard from his maternal aunt \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who reported that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Were it not for the fact that the people have recently left Kufr\", i.e., they have recently embraced Islam and departed from Kufr. \"and that I do not have enough funds\" i.e., I do not possess enough money to enable me to build it, I would incorporate into the House \"from the Hijr\" - which is the circular structure around the Ka'bah from the side opposite the Black Stone and the Yemeni Corner, and it takes the shape of a semicircle adjacent to the Levantine and Iraqi Corners, and this Hijr is part of the Ka'bah - \"five cubits\"; In another version by Muslim: \"and I added to it six cubits from the Hijr.\" This is because the Quraysh did not have enough money to construct the Ka\u2018bah. So, they built it according to their available means and left the remaining part outside and called it Hijr. Therefore, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) wanted to include it in the House. Then the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"and make for it a door through which people enter\", which is the eastern door, \"and a door through which they exit\", which is the western one. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) decided not to demolish the Ka'bah and incorporate the Hijr into it out of fear of possible Fitnah (confusion, strife), so he left it as it was. After narrating the Had\u012bth, Ibn az-Zubayr said: \"Today I have the funds\", and I possess money sufficient for this purpose, and I do not fear Fitnah for the people as Im\u0101n (faith) is well established in their hearts. So he added to the Sacred House, incorporated into it five cubits from the Hijr, and dug an area in the ground of the Hijr till he reached the foundation of the House, upon which Abraham (peace be upon him) constructed the building, and the people saw and observed it. Ibn Az-Zubayr built the structure upon it. \"The length of the Ka'bah was 18 cubits, and when he added to it, he regarded it as short,\" i.e., he considered it to be short. So, Ibn az-Zubayr increased its length by ten cubits. A cubit is about 69 cm. \"and he made for it two doors: one for entrance and the other for exit.\" So, Ibn Az-Zubayr built the Ka'bah according to the design intended by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\nWhen Ibn az-Zubayr was killed in 73 A.H., and the caliphate was established for Banu Umayyah, Al-Hajj\u0101j ibn Y\u016bsuf ath-Thaqafi sent a message to \u2018Abdul-Malik ibn Marw\u0101n - the then Caliph of the Levant - informing him \"that Ibn az-Zubayr had placed the structure upon a foundation\" i.e., upon the foundation of Abraham, which he revealed when the Hijr was dug; \"that was seen\" i.e., observed \"by the upright people\", those whose testimony is acceptable, \"in Makkah\"; so, should he leave it in the way Ibn az-Zubayr built it or demolish it and then rebuild it according to its old design? \u2018Abdul-Malik sent a reply to Al-Hajj\u0101j: \"We do not have anything to do with Ibn Zubayr's smearing\", i.e., we have nothing to do with the blame for the crime Ibn Az-Zubayr perpetrated by demolishing the Ka\u2018bah. In other words, we are innocent of his crime of demolishing the House. \"As for the addition he had made to its length, approve it\", i.e., keep it as it is. \"As for the addition he had made to it from the Hijr, revert it to its structure,\" i.e., demolish it and restore it to its former structure, as it was during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). \"and seal up the door he had opened\"; this is the other door, which Ibn Az-Zubayr added. So, Al-Hajj\u0101j demolished the House and restored it to its former structure.\nThe Had\u012bth highlights the significance of seeking the opinion of those with sound judgment and experience.\nIt mentions the repair of the damaged part of the Sacred House.\nIt indicates the permissibility of abandoning something recommended and legitimate for fear that people may fail to understand it.\nIt also indicates that an interest may be abandoned for the sake of being safe from falling into evil.\nIt shows how the ruler should win the hearts of his subjects and work to protect them.\nThe Had\u012bth demonstrates how the Companions were keen to comply with what the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) wanted.\nIt points out that the Istikh\u0101rah prayer should be performed with regard to important matters.."}, {"number": 460, "hadith": "Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s reported:  The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came across a caravan at Ar-Rawh\u0101\u2019. He said: Who are the people? They replied: The Muslims. Then, they asked: Who are you? He said: The Messenger of Allah. So, a woman lifted up a boy to him and said: Is Hajj counted for this one? He said: Yes, and you will have a reward..", "commentary": "Islam has laid down certain conditions for a Muslim to be held accountable for religious duties and obligations. One of these conditions is making Hajj obligatory only upon the adult, sane, and free Muslim who has the ability.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reports that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) \"came across a caravan,\" i.e., a traveling group. A caravan specifically refers to the owners of camels. And it is originally used to refer to ten or less than that. \"At Ar-Rawh\u0101\u2019\", is a village located almost 80 km away from Mad\u012bnah, that was on the way back from the Farewell Hajj, as mentioned in the narration of An-Nas\u0101\u2019i. He asked them: \"Who are the people?\" They answered him saying that they were from the Muslims. Then, they asked him (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): \"Who are you?\" He replied: \"The Messenger of Allah\". Perhaps they did not recognize him (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) because they had not seen him before, as they did not emigrate, i.e., they embraced Islam in their countries and did not emigrate before this incident.\nOn knowing that he was the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), a woman from among them lifted up a little boy - one who had not reached the age of puberty - and she asked: \"Is Hajj counted for this one?\", i.e., does this little boy obtain the reward of Hajj? The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) answered her, saying: \"Yes\" he gets the reward of voluntary Hajj, \"and you will have a reward,\" i.e., because of making him avoid what the Muhrim (one in state of ritual consecration) avoids, and doing what the Muhrim does, and teaching him if he is discerning, or the reward of being his deputy in Ihr\u0101m (state of ritual consecration), throwing the pebbles, standing, and carrying him during Taw\u0101f (circumambulating the Ka\u2018bah) and Sa\u2018y (walking at a brisk pace between Safa and Marwah) if he is undiscerning. His saying: \"And you will have a reward\" is meant to encourage her.\nA boy's Hajj is valid, and he gets a reward for it; however, it does not exempt him from the obligation, and he will have to perform the obligatory Hajj after reaching puberty.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates the permissibility of performing Hajj on behalf of the minor in general.\nIt also makes it clear that the boy is rewarded for his act of obedience and his virtuous deeds are recorded for him.\nThe Had\u012bth also affirms the reward of the boy's guardian if he makes him perform Hajj.\nIt also denotes that whoever does not know something must ask the scholars about the rulings he does not know.\nIt points out that whoever helps someone offer an act of obedience gets rewarded.."}, {"number": 461, "hadith": "\u2018Ali al-Azdi reported that Ibn \u2018Umar taught them:  Whenever the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) mounted his camel to set out on a journey, he would say Takb\u012br three times and then say: \"Subh\u0101na al-ladhi sakhkhara lana h\u0101dha wa ma kunna lahu muqrin\u012bn wa inna ila rabbina lamunqalib\u016bn.

O Allah, we ask You on this journey of ours for goodness and piety, and for deeds that are pleasing to You. O Allah, make this journey easy for us and make its distance short for us. O Allah, You are the Companion on the journey and the One in Whose care we leave our family behind. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from this journey's hardships, from the terrible sights, and from a misfortunate return to our property and our family).\" On returning, he would say the same and add: \"\u0100yib\u016bn t\u0101\u2019ib\u016bn \u2018\u0101bid\u016bn lirabbina h\u0101mid\u016bn (We are returning in safety, turning to our Lord in repentance, worshiping Him, and praising Him).\".", "commentary": "Traveling involves hardship and fatigue, but Allah Almighty, out of His mercy, has created for His slaves and guided them to make ships that they could ride on the sea; camels, horses, and cars that they could ride on land; and airplanes that they could ride in the air. They carry them to their destinations without any fatigue or hardship. So, when they settle on them, they remember the favor that Allah Almighty has bestowed on them by subjugating and making such mounts and vehicles easy for them to ride.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) teaches some of his companions the supplication for traveling. He informed them that when the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) rode and settled on his mount - which was the camel, and this includes all types of animals that could be ridden and the modern means of transportation - to set out from Mad\u012bnah on some journey, he would remember Allah and say: \"All\u0101hu akbar (Allah is the Greatest)\", three times. The Prophet's (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) saying Takb\u012br when riding and settling on the mount was acknowledging the greatness of Allah Almighty and the fact that He is greater than everything. He, thus, proclaimed His greatness to thank Him for that, so Allah would grant him extra bounty from Himself. Then, he would say: \"Glory be to Him Who has subjected this for us\" and has made it submissive to us, referring to the mount. \"For we could not have done it by ourselves,\" i.e., we could not have been able to subjugate it and use it if Allah Almighty had not subjected it for us. \"and we will surely return to our Lord,\" i.e., surely, we will return and go back to our Lord after death. It is as if the traveler who rides on what Allah has subjected for him remembers the last journey in this world, which is one's journey to Allah Almighty when he dies and people carry him on their shoulders.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would praise Allah and supplicate Him saying: \"O Allah, we ask You on this journey of ours for goodness and piety,\" Birr (goodness): adherence to obedience. Taqwa (piety): refraining from sins; thus, obeying the commands and avoiding the prohibitions. Then, he would ask his Lord to grant him deeds so that He becomes pleased with him. After that, he would ask Allah to make the journey easy for him and make its distance short for him. Following his supplication, he would say: \"O Allah, You are the Companion on the journey,\" i.e., You accompany me on my journey and, thus, You make it easy for me. \"And the One in Whose care we leave our family behind,\" in my absence, so, You surround them with Your care and protection, as Allah Almighty is with man on his journey and the One Who takes care of his family in his absence because Allah Almighty encompasses all things.\nThen, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would seek refuge with Allah from some of what afflicts man during his journey including: \"This journey's hardships,\" i.e., its severity, difficulty, and the fatigue it causes. and \"the terrible sights,\" i.e., the change in the face as if one is sick, and the feeling of defeat as a result of seeing what one likes undergoing something bad, which causes grief and sadness. It was also said: It means seeking refuge with Allah from every sight that results in grief when looking at it. \"A misfortunate return,\" indicates when returning and seeing what displeases him in his family and property. In the Had\u012bth of \u2018Abdullah ibn Sarjis (may Allah be pleased with him) - in Sah\u012bh Muslim and Musnad Ahmad - it was mentioned that he would start with \"the family\" on returning, as he would say: \"And from a misfortunate return to our family and our property\" instead of \"our property and our family.\" The Had\u012bth also states: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) sought refuge from \"Hawr\" after \"Kawr\", i.e., from scarcity after abundance and from the change in state from obedience to sin. He also sought refuge from the supplication of an oppressed person, i.e., I seek refuge with You from oppression, as it leads the oppressed person to engage in supplication, and there is no barrier between it and Allah, as mentioned in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections.\nOn returning, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would say these aforementioned words and would add: \u0100ib\u016bn (We are returning), i.e., we are returning from the journey safely. T\u0101ib\u016bn: (We are repenting), i.e., turning to our Lord from sins to obedience. \u0100bid\u016bn, lirabbina h\u0101mid\u016bn (We are worshiping Him, and praising our Lord,) i.e., praising Allah Almighty with His attributes of perfection and majesty and showing gratitude to Him for His blessings and favors. It means: We are on our way back to our country, homeland, and families, and we are determined to return to Allah in sincere repentance coupled with righteous deeds, including showing gratitude to Allah, worshiping Him on a regular basis, and drawing close to Him by prayer and frequent prostrations.\nSo, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to remember Allah's worship and the fact that he was a slave of Allah Almighty all the time.\nThe Had\u012bth urges the act of Allah's remembrance when setting out on a journey and on returning therefrom.."}, {"number": 462, "hadith": "\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"There is no day on which Allah sets free more of His slaves from the Fire than the Day of \u2018Arafah. He verily draws near, then He boasts about them before the angels saying: 'What do these [people] want?'\".", "commentary": "Allah has favored some days over others, and these favored days are occasions for Allah's grants and gifts that He offers His slaves, forgiving sins and elevating degrees, and the Day of \u2018Arafah is one of these virtuous days.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) says that saving people from torment and setting them free from the Fire takes place on a larger scale on the Day of \u2018Arafah than on any other day. \u2018Arafah is a spot located on the way between Makkah and T\u0101\u2019if. It is almost 22 kilometers away from Makkah, 10 kilometers away from Mina, and 6 kilometers away from Muzdalifah. It is the place where the pilgrims stand on the 9th of Dhul-Hijjah supplicating to Allah and asking for His forgiveness. \"He\" the Almighty verily \"draws near\" in a manner that befits His majesty and greatness, in compliance with what Allah Almighty has established for Himself, without Tashb\u012bh (drawing comparison) or Tamth\u012bl (likening Him to His creatures). Then, He boasts before the angels about the Muslims standing at \u2018Arafah, demonstrating their merit and the excellence of what they do, and praising them before the angels. The word \"bah\u0101\u2019\" (boast) originally means beauty and grace. So, Allah boasts about them and praises them in the angels' presence. \"Saying: What do these [people] want?\", i.e., what do these people want by leaving their families and homelands, spending their money, and exhausting their bodies? The answer is omitted, and it is assumed to be: They only sought Allah's forgiveness and pleasure, which indicates that they are granted forgiveness, as Allah does not boast about sinners and wrongdoers except after repenting and being granted forgiveness.\nThe Had\u012bth establishes the attribute of drawing near to Allah Almighty in a way that befits His majesty and greatness.\nIt also establishes the attribute of boasting for Allah Almighty in a way that befits His majesty and greatness.."}, {"number": 463, "hadith": "J\u0101bir reported that he heard the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say:  \"It is not lawful for any of you to carry a weapon in Makkah.\".", "commentary": "Makkah is a sacred city as it has the Sacred House and sacred sites. The Shariah has legislated for its special rulings that affirm such meanings. It has legislated therein means of security that have not been legislated in any other spot on earth.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade carrying weapons in Makkah. Perhaps the reason behind this is to prevent it from being a cause of terrifying a Muslim or doing harm to anyone. Undoubtedly, this enhances the sense of security in a place like Makkah where the Islamic sacred sites are found. The prohibition here is meant when there is no necessity for carrying a weapon. However, if there is a necessity - like fighting the disbelievers and their likes - it is permissible to carry weapons like what happened in the Year of the Conquest when the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) entered Makkah with his armies carrying their weapons. Allah granted him permission to do so to spread His religion and make His word superior. Hence, Allah made this Sanctuary lawful for him for part of the day, from sunrise to \u2018Asr prayer.

The words \"two ends\" are reported like this, in the plural form, whereas it is narrated by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd in the singular form 'end', which is more preponderant.\nThe Had\u012bth makes mention of wearing a black turban.."}, {"number": 466, "hadith": "N\u0101fi\u2018 ibn Jubayr reported:  Marw\u0101n ibn al-Hakam addressed the people and made mention of Makkah and its inhabitants and inviolability. Still, he did not mention Mad\u012bnah and its inhabitants or inviolability. Thereupon, R\u0101fi\u2018 ibn Khad\u012bj called him and said: \"What is it that I hear you making mention of Makkah and its inhabitants and its inviolability, but you did not make mention of Mad\u012bnah and its inhabitants and its inviolability, while the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) declared what is between its two lava fields as inviolable?!

Allah rendered Makkah a sanctuary for Abraham (Ibr\u0101h\u012bm) (peace be upon him) and made it a safe town. Likewise, He rendered Mad\u012bnah a sanctuary for the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\nThis Had\u012bth points out that Mad\u012bnah is sacred like Makkah. This version has a story. Marw\u0101n ibn al-Hakam - the then-governor of Mad\u012bnah - addressed the people and mentioned Makkah and its people and its inviolability but did not mention Mad\u012bnah and its people and its inviolability. Its inviolability means that everything becomes secure therein, even animals, which may not be hunted, and trees, which may not be cut down, and that no one may do anything in it that contradicts the religion of Allah or commit a crime, an act of injustice, or a sin for which a legal punishment is prescribed. So, it is forbidden to hunt in Mad\u012bnah as it is forbidden in the sanctuary of Makkah, but he who hunts in Mad\u012bnah faces no punishment, for it is not a place for the rituals, unlike Makkah.\nSo, R\u0101fi\u2018 ibn Khad\u012bj (may Allah be pleased with him) called him and said: \"What is it that I hear you making mention of Makkah and its inhabitants and sacredness, but you did not make mention of Mad\u012bnah and its inhabitants and its inviolability, while the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) declared what is between its two lava fields as inviolable?!\" He meant that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) declared all of Mad\u012bnah inviolable. Mad\u012bnah lies between two lava fields, eastern and western. A lava field is a land covered with black stones as if it was burned. The eastern lava field is called \"Harrat W\u0101qim\", and it now contains Qub\u0101' and the W\u0101qim fortress. The western lava field is \"Harrat Wabarah\", and it contains the mosque called the Mosque of the Two Qiblahs. Its borders from the south and north are between the two mountains' Ayr and Thawr. The Prophetic Sanctuary falls between Mount' Ayr from the south, 8.5km away from the Prophet's Mosque, and Mount Thawr from the north, 8km away from the Prophet's Mosque. An official committee in Saudi Arabia has demarcated the Mad\u012bnah sanctuary, and the Mad\u012bnah Regional Municipality has put architectural signs in the form of arches like those of the Prophet's Mosque, in many places demonstrating these borders.\nThen, R\u0101fi\u2018 (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"And this is with us\" written \"on Khawl\u0101ni parchment\", which is skin attributed to Khawl\u0101n, a village in Yemen. Perhaps this skin is characterized by strength and durability suitable for keeping such things. Then, R\u0101fi\u2018 said to him: \"If you wish, I can make you read it\", i.e., if you want to verify this matter by reading the text by yourself, I will enable you to read it. Thereupon, Marw\u0101n kept silent and then acknowledged that, saying: \"I heard part of that,\" i.e., the Had\u012bth in which the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) declared Mad\u012bnah inviolable.\nThe Had\u012bth demonstrates the status of Mad\u012bnah.\nIt indicates that a knowledgeable person should alert others if they make a mistake or forget or overlook a Shar\u2018i ruling.."}, {"number": 467, "hadith": "Sa\u2018d reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"I declare inviolable what is between the two lava plains of Mad\u012bnah, so its thorn trees must not be cut down and its game must not be killed.\" He also said: \"Mad\u012bnah is best for them if they only knew. No one leaves it out of dislike for it except that Allah will replace him with someone better, and no one remains therein despite its hardships and distress except that I shall be an intercessor or a witness for him on the Day of Judgment.\" [Another narration reads]: And no one intends to harm the people of Mad\u012bnah except that Allah will cause him to melt in fire like the melting of lead or the dissolution of salt in water..", "commentary": "Allah Almighty has granted Makkah and Mad\u012bnah a special position that excels other places and positions on account of the Islamic sacred sites found therein, like the Sacred House in Makkah and the Prophet's Mosque in Mad\u012bnah.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) says: \"I declare inviolable what is between the two lava plains of Mad\u012bnah,\" i.e., it is a safe sanctuary, so everything therein should be safe. \"Two lava plains\": Lava plain, i.e., lava field, which is an area of land with black rocks as if burnt with fire. Mad\u012bnah - may Allah increase its honor - is located between two lava fields on the east and the west. The eastern lava field (Harrat W\u0101qim) now has Qub\u0101\u2019 and W\u0101qim Fort, whereas the western lava field is Harrat Wabarah, which has a mosque called Masjid Al-Qiblatayn. Its borders from the south and north are between the two mountains \u2018Ayr and Thawr. The Prophetic Sanctuary falls between Mount \u2018Ayr from the south, which is 8.5 kilometers away from the Prophet's Mosque, and Mount Thawr from the north, which is 8 kilometers away from the Prophet's Mosque. An official committee in Saudi Arabia has demarcated the Mad\u012bnah sanctuary, and the Mad\u012bnah Regional Municipality has put architectural signs in the form of arches, like those of the Prophet's Mosque, in many places demonstrating these borders.\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) then clarified what is prohibited within these borders, as it is prohibited to cut down thorn trees, i.e., all trees having thorns, and it is prohibited to hunt animals and birds therein, as they are protected within these borders.\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) then informed us of some of the merits of Mad\u012bnah, saying: \"Mad\u012bnah is best for them if they only knew,\" referring to people who would leave Mad\u012bnah, i.e., Mad\u012bnah is best for those leaving it from such countries for whose sake they are leaving it. Then, he clarified that anyone who leaves and abandons it from among its dwellers out of dislike for it, i.e., out of aversion or unwillingness to get a reward for living there, Allah will replace him with someone better in Mad\u012bnah, whether a child born there or someone moving from another city and settling therein.\nThen he added that anyone who remains steadfast, patiently enduring its hardships, i.e., straitened circumstances and hunger, \"and distress\", i.e., its difficulties, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) will be an intercessor or a witness for him on the Day of Judgment. The meaning of this may be: the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) will be a witness for some of the people of Mad\u012bnah and an intercessor for the rest of them; or he will be an intercessor for the sinners and a witness for the obedient ones; or a witness for those who die during his lifetime and an intercessor for those who die after him; or maybe \"or\" here is used in the sense of \"and\", i.e., he will be an intercessor and a witness for them. This is an exclusive merit in addition to the intercession for the sinners or for the worlds on the Day of Judgment and in addition to his testimony to the entire Ummah.\nIn another narration, he said: \"And no one intends to harm the people of Mad\u012bnah except that Allah will cause him to melt in fire like the melting of lead or the dissolution of salt in water,\" i.e., this will happen to him in the Hereafter. This could also mean: Whoever has ill will towards it during the Prophet's lifetime, or in this worldly life, Muslims will be spared of his harm and his plot will fade away just as the lead fades away in fire. Thus, Allah will not grant him a respite and will not grant him authority; rather, He will soon eliminate him.\nThe Had\u012bth stresses the importance of Mad\u012bnah and its great inviolability.\nIt also points out how Allah Almighty hastens to inflict His severe punishment on whoever intends to harm Mad\u012bnah and its people.."}, {"number": 468, "hadith": "\u2018\u0100mir ibn Saad reported:  Saad rode to his castle in Al-\u2018Aq\u012bq and found a slave cutting down the trees or beating them.

Thereupon, he said: \"Allah forbid that I should give back anything which the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) has given me as a spoil!\" He refused to return anything to them..", "commentary": "Allah Almighty has given Makkah and Mad\u012bnah greater status than other places and positions.

Al-\u2018Aq\u012bq means: what was ripped by the flood a long time ago. He found a slave cutting trees from the sanctuary of Mad\u012bnah or beating them. In other words, he was beating the tree leaves or throwing stones at them. So, Saad (may Allah be pleased with him) took all his belongings, i.e., he took the clothes he was wearing and other things which would be taken from a killed person among the disbelievers, which include his horse, weapon, money, etc. The people of the slave came and asked him to return to their slave or to them what he had taken from their slave. He declined that, citing the Prophet's instruction regarding anyone who does so within the sanctuary of Mad\u012bnah. He said: Allah forbid that I should give back anything which the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) has given me as a spoil, i.e., booty with his permission to anyone who sees someone hunting or cutting trees that he may take his belongings. So, he refused to return what he had taken from them. This is all intended to show extreme rejection and deterrence, and it is also because he considered this act worthy of criticism and firm response so that this issue could spread among the people so that they would refrain from hunting and cutting trees in Mad\u012bnah.."}, {"number": 469, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah reported:  When the people saw the first fruits, they would bring them to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and when the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) received them, he would say: \"O Allah, bless for us our fruits, bless for us our Mad\u012bnah, bless for us our S\u0101\u2018, and bless for us our Mudd. O Allah, indeed Abraham is Your slave, friend, and Prophet, and indeed I am Your slave and Prophet; and he supplicated You regarding Makkah, and I supplicate You regarding Mad\u012bnah with the same supplication he made to You for Makkah and the like of it along with it.\" He said: Then, he would call the youngest child and give these fruits to him..", "commentary": "Allah Almighty has endowed some places in the world with particular blessings which He has not given to other places. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to supplicate Allah to bless Mad\u012bnah and its people and fruits and to fill it with goodness and blessing, as Abraham, the friend of Allah (peace be upon him), supplicated for Makkah.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that when the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) \"saw the first fruits\", which is the first produce and the first fruits to become ripe in their farms, they would bring them to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) as a gift to him, or they would do that out of a desire for the Prophet's supplication and to notify him of the fruits becoming ripe and the Zakah related to them. When the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) received them, he would supplicate for them, saying: \"O Allah, bless for us our fruits\" with growth, increase, and continuity. Then, he would supplicate for Mad\u012bnah, saying: \"bless for us our Mad\u012bnah\", i.e., in its essence in terms of its opulence and the opulence of its people and so on. Blessing is intended to refer to blessing in this world and the Hereafter. Then, he supplicated with regard to the S\u0101\u2018 and Mudd of Mad\u012bnah, saying: \"bless for us our S\u0101 ', and bless for us our Mudd\", i.e., bless for us what is measured in our S\u0101 'and bless for us what is measured in our Mudd, making what is in it more sufficient than what lies elsewhere. The S\u0101\u2018 of Mad\u012bnah is a measure that consists of four Mudds, and a Mudd equals one pound and a third among the people of Hejaz and two pounds elsewhere.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) supplicated for Mad\u012bnah as Abraham (peace be upon him) supplicated for Makkah; he said: \"O Allah, indeed Abraham is Your slave, friend, and Prophet, and indeed I am Your slave and Prophet; and he supplicated You regarding Makkah\" by saying: {So make the people\u2019s hearts incline towards them, and provide for them fruits, so that they may be grateful.} [Surat Ibr\u0101h\u012bm: 37] Meaning, provide the people of Makkah with fruits by bringing them from other lands so that they may show gratitude for this blessing. Certainly, Allah answered his supplication and made it a safe sanctuary to which all different fruits are brought.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"And I supplicate You regarding Mad\u012bnah with the same supplication he made to You for Makkah and the like of it along with it,\" i.e., with the double of what Abraham (peace be upon him) supplicated for. Thus, Mad\u012bnah should have double the blessing in the fruits.\nThen, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would give these fruits he received to the youngest child present, and he probably gave them to children in particular because they have a greater desire, want, and longing for them.\nThe Had\u012bth demonstrates the Prophet's noble manners, great compassion and mercy, and gentle attitude toward the old and young.\nIt shows the Prophet's love for Mad\u012bnah.."}, {"number": 470, "hadith": "Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd, the freed slave of Al-Mahri, reported:  they suffered distress and hardship in Mad\u012bnah, and he came to Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Khudri and said to him: \"I have a lot of dependents, and we are enduring hardship. I have, therefore, made up my mind to take my dependents to some rural land.\" Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd said: \"Do not do that; stick to Mad\u012bnah, for indeed we came out with the Prophet of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) - I think he said:- until we reached 'Usf\u0101n, and he stayed there for some nights. The people said: 'By Allah, we are here for nothing, whereas our children are unprotected, and we do not feel secure about them.' This was conveyed to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and he said: 'What is this that was conveyed to me from your speech?! - I do not know what he said: By the One by Whom I swear, or by the One in Whose Hand my soul is - I made up my mind, or if you will - I do not know which of that he said - that I should command my she-camel be prepared for proceeding and I will not untie any of its knots until I come to Mad\u012bnah.' Then, he said: 'O Allah, indeed Abraham declared Makkah as sacred and rendered it a sanctuary, and I declare Mad\u012bnah as sacred and a sanctuary between its two mountains. Thus, no blood is to be shed on it, no weapon is to be carried therein for fighting, and the leaves of trees are not to be beaten off except for fodder. O Allah, bless us in our city; O Allah, bless us in our S\u0101 '; O Allah, bless us in our Mudd; O Allah, bless us in our S\u0101 '; O Allah, bless us in our Mudd; O Allah, bless us in our city; O Allah, give with the blessing two more blessings. By the One in Whose Hand my soul is, there is no ravine or mountain path in Mad\u012bnah which two angels do not guard until you reach there.' Then, he said to the people: 'Proceed,' We proceeded and came to Mad\u012bnah. By the One in Whose name we take oath - or in Whose name oath is taken - we had hardly put down our camel saddles upon entering Mad\u012bnah that we were attacked by Banu \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn Ghataf\u0101n, and nothing prevented them from doing it before that.\".", "commentary": "Allah Almighty endowed some places of the world with particular blessings that He did not give to other places, and He made some places locations for evils and trials and some others locations for goodness and blessings. The Prophet's Mad\u012bnah has been endowed with abundant goodness and blessing.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd, the freed slave of Al-Mahri, who was living in Mad\u012bnah, relates that they suffered distress and hardship due to poverty and lack of provisions, he complained to Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) about his condition and that he had \"a lot of dependents,\" i.e., the members of one's household and those he supports; and he wants to leave Mad\u012bnah and go to some rural land where there are plants and fertility. In response, Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) enjoined him to stick to Mad\u012bnah and not leave it. Clarifying the reason behind that, he mentioned that they went out of Makkah along with the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) until they reached 'Usf\u0101n, a village lying 80km to the northwest of Makkah. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) stayed in it for nights and days. The people said: \"We are here for nothing,\" i.e., business or work, or anything related to war. \"whereas our children are unprotected,\" i.e., without men or any means of protection. We left them behind, and \"we do not feel secure about them\"; rather, we fear for them that the enemy may attack them while we are away. These words reached the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and he asked them: \"What is this that was conveyed to me from your speech\" regarding your dependents and families?! Then Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"I do not know what he said\"; Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) was doubtful about the oath taken by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), whether he said: \"By the One by Whom I swear, or by the One in Whose Hand my soul is\"; the latter is the form the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would mostly use for swearing. Also, Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd was in doubt about whether the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"I made up my mind, or if you will\", meaning he resolved and intended to do something, but he did not actually do it, or he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) left the matter to them; and that is: to command his she-camel be saddled and prepared for riding and travel and he would ride it and proceed and not untie any of the knots of the luggage loaded on it till he reaches Mad\u012bnah. This indicates that they alighted in 'Usf\u0101n for rest and to let their animals rest. Had it not been for that, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would have hastened to Mad\u012bnah nonstop, which shows the Prophet's intense love for Mad\u012bnah.\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"O Allah, indeed Abraham declared Makkah as sacred and rendered it a sanctuary\", i.e., he proclaimed its sacredness and informed people that it is a sanctuary because Allah made it sacred. \"And I declare Mad\u012bnah as sacred\"; the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) rendered it \"a sanctuary between its two mountains.\" In another version by Muslim: \"I declare what is between the two lava fields of Mad\u012bnah as sacred.\" A lava field is called Al-Harrah. Mad\u012bnah lies between two lava fields, eastern and western. A lava field is a land covered with black stones as if it was burned. Mad\u012bnah is bordered by Mount Thawr, behind' Uhud, from the north and Mount Ayr from the south. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) meant that he declared all of Mad\u012bnah as sacred. An official committee in Saudi Arabia has demarcated the Mad\u012bnah sanctuary, and the Mad\u012bnah Regional Municipality has put architectural signs in the form of arches like those of the Prophet's Mosque, in many places demonstrating these borders.\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) pointed out that his declaration of Mad\u012bnah as sacred means: \"that no blood is to be shed in it\", i.e., nobody is to be unjustly killed therein. The unjust shedding of blood is forbidden everywhere, but shedding it in Makkah and Mad\u012bnah is more severely forbidden. \"no weapon is to be carried for fighting\" except for self-defense and the like. And no tree should be cut off except for fodder. Fodder is a name for grass, hay, barley, and the like, and it is intended to refer to the food of animals.\nThen the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) supplicated for them to have the blessing in their foods. He said: \"O Allah, bless us in our city; O Allah, bless us in our S\u0101 '; O Allah, bless us in our Mudd\", i.e., bless the food measured by the two of them. Also, the supplication probably means that blessing should lie in the very measure, and thus, a Mudd in it be sufficient in a way not found elsewhere. The S\u0101\u2018 of Mad\u012bnah is a measure that consists of four Mudds, and a Mudd equals one pound and a third according to the people of Hejaz and two pounds elsewhere. Then the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) repeated his supplication: \"O Allah, bless us in our S\u0101 '; O Allah, bless us in our Mudd; O Allah, bless us in our city.\" And he added: \"O Allah, give with the blessing two more blessings\", supplicating Allah, the Exalted and Glorified, to increase and multiply the blessings and favors for the people of Mad\u012bnah. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) swore by Allah in Whose Hand lies the soul of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and all humankind: \"There is no ravine or mountain path in Mad\u012bnah which is not guarded by two angels\", i.e., they protect it by the command of Allah Almighty until the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and those with him returned to Mad\u012bnah. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) enjoined his Companions to prepare for travel. So, they got prepared and proceeded toward Mad\u012bnah.\nThen Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd (may Allah be pleased with him) swore by Allah Almighty - by Whom every Muslim swears - that once they unloaded their luggage from their animals as they entered Mad\u012bnah, Banu' Abdull\u0101h ibn Ghataf\u0101n raided Mad\u012bnah, those are people who used to be called Banu' Abd al-\u2018Uzza during J\u0101hiliyyah. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) called them Banu' Abdull\u0101h, and then the Arabs called them Banu Muhawwalah due to Tahw\u012bl (the change) of their name. The meaning: In their absence, Mad\u012bnah was guarded, as informed by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). No apparent cause prevented those people from raiding Mad\u012bnah before the return of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his Companions, except that Allah Almighty and His angels guarded it.\nThere is no contradiction in this Had\u012bth between the Prophet's supplication for Mad\u012bnah to be blessed and the fact that some of its people endured hardship, as there is no conflict between the existence of hardship in it and the existence of blessing and no harm done if it is lacking with regard to some people. It is said: What appears to be more correct is that the blessing in it lies in the obtainment of sustenance, and the Mudd in it is sufficient for such an amount that needs three Mudds elsewhere. So, the hardship can be endured in getting the Mudd, and the blessing is represented by multiplying the sustenance therein.\nThe Had\u012bth mentions that Allah blessed the people of Mad\u012bnah with their fruits and foods and placed blessings in their measures.\nIt demonstrates the Prophet's intense love for Mad\u012bnah and how he would yearn for it whenever he went out until he returned.\nIt points out the merit of Mad\u012bnah and that it was guarded during the Prophet's lifetime and numerous guards were stationed in all ravines, by way of increasing the honor of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).."}, {"number": 471, "hadith": "Sahl ibn Hunayf reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) pointed with his hand to Mad\u012bnah and said: \"It is a safe sanctuary.\".", "commentary": "Allah Almighty endowed some places of the world with particular blessings that He did not give to other places, and He made some places' locations for evils and trials and others' locations for goodness and blessings. The Prophet's Mad\u012bnah has been endowed with abundant goodness and blessing.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the noble Companion Sahl ibn Hunayf (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) pointed with his hand to Mad\u012bnah and then said: \"It is a safe sanctuary.\" So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) declared it - as in another version by Muslim -: \"inviolable throughout the area between its two mountain paths, that no blood should be shed in it, no weapon should be carried in it for fighting, and no leaves should be beaten off trees except for fodder.\" Fodder is a name for grass, hay, barley, etc. In another version in the Sah\u012bh Muslim Collection: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"I declare inviolable the area between the two lava fields of Mad\u012bnah, that its large thorn trees should not be cut down or its game be killed.\" The meaning: It is forbidden to cut down its trees or kill its game. Its sanctuary lies between its two lava fields, the eastern and the western. A lava field is a land covered with black stones as if it was burned. Mad\u012bnah is bordered by Mount Thawr to the north, behind \u2019Uhud, and by Mount \u2018Ayr to the south.."}, {"number": 472, "hadith": "Yuhannas, the freed slave of Az-Zubayr, reported that while sitting with 'Abdull\u0101h ibn Umar at the time of the trial, one of his freed female slaves came and greeted him. She said: \"I want to leave, O 'Abu' Abdur-Rahm\u0101n. The time has become harsh for us.\" Thereupon, 'Abdull\u0101h said to her: \"Stay, O you Lak\u0101 ', for indeed I have heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say:  'No one patiently endures its hunger and hardship except that I will be a witness or intercessor for him on the Day of Judgment.'\".", "commentary": "Allah, the Exalted and Glorified, endowed some places of the earth with particular blessings that He did not give to other places, and He made some of them locations for evils and trials and others for goodness and blessings. The Prophet's Mad\u012bnah has been endowed with abundant goodness, blessing, and merit.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Yuhannas, the freed slave of Az-Zubayr - or the freed slave of Mus\u2018ab ibn az-Zubayr - relates that while he was sitting in the company of \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b (may Allah be pleased with him), \"one of his freed female slaves came and greeted him\", a greeting of farewell, as she wanted to leave Mad\u012bnah. This was at a time in which some tribulations occurred among the Muslims, involving fighting and the like. He was apparently referring to the trial of Al-Harrah, which took place during the reign of Yaz\u012bd ibn Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah. She said: \"I want to leave\" Mad\u012bnah, \"O \u2018Abu \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n\", the surname of \u2018Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). And she said: \"The time has become harsh for us.\" This demonstrates the reason behind her desire to depart from Mad\u012bnah. She meant that famine had become severe at this time because of the trial. Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) disapproved of that and urged her to stay in Mad\u012bnah, given the merit of doing so. He said: \"Stay, O you Lak\u0101 '\". The word 'Lak\u0101\" is used to refer to a vile person, a slave, a fool who does not benefit from the speech of others, or a child. Ibn' Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) addressed her by this word in a friendly manner and to express disapproval of her desire to depart from Mad\u012bnah, for one should not leave it due to difficulty and hardship.\nThen, he clarified to her why he enjoined her to stay in Mad\u012bnah, and this is because he heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say: \"No one patiently endures its hunger and hardship except that I will be a witness or intercessor for him on the Day of Judgment.\" The intended meaning is that he will be a witness for some of the people of Mad\u012bnah and an intercessor for the rest of them; or an intercessor for the disobedient and a witness for the obedient; or a witness for those who die during his lifetime and an intercessor for those who die after him; or the word 'or' here means 'and', in which case the meaning will be that he will be an intercessor and witness for him. This is an additional characteristic besides the intercession for sinners or humankind on the Day of Judgment and besides his testimony over the entire Ummah.\nThe Had\u012bth urges dwelling in Mad\u012bnah.\nIt points out the merit of patiently enduring hardship and hunger in Mad\u012bnah.\nIt demonstrates the Prophet's favor upon the people of Mad\u012bnah.."}, {"number": 473, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"The Anti-Christ (Al-Mas\u012bh ad-Dajj\u0101l) will come from the east with the intention to attack Mad\u012bnah until he will alight behind' Uhud, and then the angels will dissuade his face toward the Levant, and there he will be destroyed.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet's Mad\u012bnah possesses great merits, and Allah Almighty has protected it from evils and ills and the Anti-Christ, preventing him from entering it, as He also protects Makkah from him by virtue of the Prophet's supplication for it.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informs that the Anti-Christ will be keen on going to the Prophet's Mad\u012bnah, and his primary goal and intention behind entering it will be to destroy and ruin it. \"he will alight behind' Uhud\", i.e., he will reach the area behind Mount' Uhud, the well-known mountain lying on the outskirts of Mad\u012bnah from the north and situated 4 or 5km away from the Prophet's Mosque. In his story in which he met the Anti-Christ, Tam\u012bm ad-D\u0101ri narrated that he said to him: \"and I will travel in the land and not leave any town except that I will stay in it for forty nights, except for Makkah and Taybah (Mad\u012bnah), as both of them are forbidden for me. Each time I try to enter one of them, an angel with a sword in his hand unsheathed will confront me and bar my way, and there are angels to guard every passage leading to it.\" [Narrated by Muslim] But, the angels who guard Mad\u012bnah will direct him toward the Levant, which nowadays includes Syria, Jordan, Palestine, and Lebanon. The Anti-Christ will come to the Levant, and there he will be destroyed, as Jesus the son of Mary (\u2018\u012asa the son of Mariyam) (peace be upon both of them) will descend at the white minaret in eastern Damascus, placing his hands on the wings of two angels. Then, he will pursue him and find him at the gate of Ludd, where the Messiah, the son of Mary, will kill him. as related in another Had\u012bth narrated by Muslim and others.\nThe Anti-Christ was called Mas\u012bh because one of his eyes is Mams\u016bh (effaced); he is one-eyed. He is a person from the children of Adam, and his emergence is one of the major signs of the Day of Judgment. Allah will afflict His servants through him and enable him to do things of which only Allah Almighty is capable: bringing the dead person he will kill back to life, the emergence of worldly flourishment and abundance along with him, his paradise and fire, his two rivers, the treasures of earth going after him, and his command to the sky to rain and it will rain and to the earth to produce plants and it will produce plants. All this will happen by the will and power of Allah Almighty. He will come on this day from the east. In a Had\u012bth narrated by At-Tirmidhi, Abu Bakr as-Sidd\u012bq (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"The Ant-Christ will emerge from a land in the east called Khur\u0101s\u0101n,\" which is located in the east of Iraq.."}, {"number": 474, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"A time will come for the people when a man will invite his cousin and relative: 'Come to prosperity, come to prosperity.' But Mad\u012bnah is better for them if they only knew. By the One in Whose Hand my soul is, none amongst them will go out with a dislike for it except that Allah will make someone better succeed him therein. Indeed, Mad\u012bnah is like a bellows, which expels the impurities. The Last Hour will not come until Mad\u012bnah banishes its evils just as a bellows eliminates the impurities of iron.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet's Mad\u012bnah is a blessed spot on earth. Allah rid it of impurities and chose it to be the place of Hijrah for the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), the incubator of his mission and the foundation of his state.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informs that a time will come for the people when a man will call his cousin and relative, saying: \"Come to prosperity\", i.e., leave Mad\u012bnah and hasten to prosperity. By this, he meant that countries would be conquered by the Muslims, and thus, there would be abundant fortunes. Consequently, many of those who left the Hejaz and the Arab land would be inclined to the fortunes they found in these conquered countries and would take them as a homeland and invite their relatives in Mad\u012bnah to come to them, given the difficult living there. But in reality, staying in Mad\u012bnah is better for them as it is the sanctuary of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his refuge and the place where divine revelation and blessings descended if they only knew the religious benefits and results of staying in it, compared to which the worldly transient and fleeting fortunes they find in living elsewhere would seem trivial. Or the meaning: If they only had any knowledge, i.e., Would that they were among the people of knowledge - by way of emphasis and rebuke.\nThen the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) took an oath, saying: \"By the One in Whose Hand my soul is\", and this is swearing by Allah, Who possesses the life and soul, \"none amongst them will go out\" i.e., none of those who live in it will abandon and leave it, disliking and being disinterested in it, or disinterested the reward for dwelling in it, except that Allah, the Glorified and Exalted, will make a better person than him will succeed him - who will be born in Mad\u012bnah or move to it from another place. Then the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) mentioned that it banishes evil people from it, and they do not bear to live therein. Only the righteous believers bear to stay in it. Indeed, it does not leave in it anyone in whose heart there is wickedness and corruption. Rather, it distinguishes him from people with sincere hearts and drives him out, as fire separates bad iron from good one. A bellows is the leather by which the blacksmith blows into the fire. The Hour will not occur until Mad\u012bnah banishes its evils just as a bellows eliminates the impurities of iron. The impurities of iron are the dirt and filth extricated therefrom by fire. It is said: It is meant to refer here to some of the hypocrites who lived during the lifetime of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Otherwise, many righteous and virtuous people left Mad\u012bnah after the Prophet's lifetime, and some wicked and evil people remained therein. It is also said That Mad\u012bnah banishes its evils, which probably applies to the time of the Dajj\u0101l and may also apply to different eras.\nThe Had\u012bth demonstrates some merits of Mad\u012bnah.\nIt includes one of the signs proving the Prophet's prophethood.."}, {"number": 475, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn Samurah reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say:  \"Indeed, Allah Almighty named Mad\u012bnah T\u0101bah.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet's Mad\u012bnah is a blessed spot on earth. Allah has purified it from filth and has chosen it to be the Prophet's destination of Hijrah (immigration), the incubator of his call, and the basis of his state.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informs that one of the names by which Allah Almighty called Mad\u012bnah is 'T\u0101bah'. The meaning is that Allah Almighty named it in the Preserved Tablet or commanded His Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to name it as such in response to the hypocrites concerning its name as Yathrib. T\u0101bah is derived from At-T\u012bb, which means good scent, or from something Tayyib (good) or something T\u0101hir (pure), for it has been purified from Shirk (polytheism). It is said: Because it is Tayyibah (good) for those who dwell in it. And it is said: Because living in it is Tayyib (good). It is also said: Because its soil and air are Tayyib. He who stays in it finds a good scent in its soil and walls that can hardly be found elsewhere.\nMad\u012bnah used to be called Yathrib before the Prophet's Hijrah to it. In the Two Sah\u012bh Collections, Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"I have been commanded to go to a town which will devour all towns. People call it Yathrib, but it is Mad\u012bnah.\" He (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) seemed to have disliked the name Yathrib, for it comes from \"Tathr\u012bb\", which means censure and punishment, or from \"Tharb\", which means corruption, and because it was the name used in J\u0101hiliyyah. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to change bad names. Also, Allah Almighty calls it Mad\u012bnah in several Qur'anic verses. When something has numerous names, this denotes its greatness.\nAs for calling it \"Yathrib\" in the Qur'anic verse that reads: {And [remember] when a group of them said: \"O people of Yathrib, you cannot withstand [the enemy attack], so go back\"} [Surat al-Ahz\u0101b: 13], this is taken as a quotation of the words of the hypocrites whose hearts had sickness.."}, {"number": 476, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah reported that Abu al-Q\u0101sim (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"Whoever intends to do harm to the people of this city - meaning Mad\u012bnah - Allah will make him dissolve just as salt dissolves in water.\".", "commentary": "Prophetic Mad\u012bnah is a blessed spot on earth.

So, whoever intends to do harm to the people of Mad\u012bnah and is determined to hurt them, Allah will make him dissolve as salt dissolves in water, and this will be in the Hereafter as mentioned in Sah\u012bh Muslim: \"No one intends evil for the people of Mad\u012bnah except that Allah will make him melt in fire like the melting of lead;\" so He made the punishment in Hellfire. This could also mean: Whoever has ill will towards it during the Prophet's lifetime, Muslims will be spared his harm, and his plot will fade away just as salt fades away in water. This could also be in reference to whoever has an ill will towards it generally in this life, so Allah will not grant him a respite and will not grant him authority; rather, He will soon eliminate him.."}, {"number": 477, "hadith": "Abu Salamah ibn \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n reported: \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n ibn Abi Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Khudri passed by me, and I said to him: What did you hear your father say about the mosque that was founded on piety? He said: I heard my father say: I entered upon the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in the house of one of his wives and I said:  O Messenger of Allah, which of the two mosques is the one founded on piety? He said: He took a handful of pebbles and threw them on the ground and then said: It is this very mosque of yours, i.e., the Mad\u012bnah Mosque.

So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) took a handful of small pebbles from the ground and threw them on the ground, then he answered the question of Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) saying: \"It is this very mosque of yours,\" i.e., the Mad\u012bnah Mosque. This is meant as a form of exaggeration in clarifying that it is the Mad\u012bnah Mosque.\nThereupon, Abu Salamah ibn \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n said to \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n ibn Abi Sa\u2018\u012bd: \"I bear witness that this is how I heard your father,\" i.e., Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him), \"make mention of it,\" i.e., he had mentioned to me the like of what you mentioned to me about it.\nThe Had\u012bth clarifies the merit of the Prophet's Mosque and the fact that it was founded on piety.."}, {"number": 478, "hadith": "J\u0101bir reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) saw a woman, so he came to his wife Zaynab, while she was tanning a Man\u012b\u2019ah (piece of leather), and satisfied his need. Then, he came out to his Companions and said:  \"The woman advances in the shape of a devil and retires in the shape of a devil. So, when any of you sees a woman, he should come to his wife, for that will repel what he feels in his heart.\" [In another version]: He did not mention: \"retires in the shape of a devil.\".", "commentary": "Islam has protected women from all evil, and the Shariah has commanded women to avoid Tabarruj (impermissible exposure of adornment), so as not to arouse desires and become a cause of tempting others.\nIn this Had\u012bth, J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reports that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) saw a woman, as if he saw her all of a sudden. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went to his wife, Zaynab bint Jahsh, to satisfy his human lust and maintain his chastity. Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her) was tanning a piece of leather, i.e., rubbing it. \"Man\u012b\u2019ah\": it is the leather once put in tannin. He did this only to clarify to people and guide them to what they should do, as he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) taught them with his acts and words. As for what he felt in his heart, he is not to be blamed for it, and it does not negatively affect his status. It is a requirement of human nature and lust. It must not be thought that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did this out of a whim or for being overcome by lust, far be it from him. Rather, he did this by way of legislation and to set an example and to ward off what is expected to happen.\nThen, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"The woman advances in the shape of a devil and retires in the shape of a devil\" referring to personal desires and inviting others to be tempted by her, given the natural inclination for women that Allah Almighty has instilled in men and the pleasure they get by looking at women and at whatever is related to them. The woman is, thus like the devil who calls to evil through his whispering and through making evil appealing to them. This is because her advance calls men to look stealthily at her just like the devil that calls to evil and whispering. The same applies to her turning back because the gaze is the heart's guide, so when she turns back, she attracts a man's gaze and he tries to take backdoors to reach her, as seeing her from all directions is a cause of corruption.\nThen, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"So, when any of you sees a woman,\" i.e., likes and admires her, because seeing something that arouses one's amazement, leads to admiring it. Another version by Muslim reads: \"When any of you admires a woman and his heart is captivated by her, he should go to his wife and have sexual intercourse with her.\" Here he said: \"He should come to his wife,\" i.e., and have sexual intercourse with her. \"For that will repel what he feels in his heart,\" i.e., his sexual intercourse with his wife will repel what he feels in his heart and will satiate his lust and calm him down.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that there is nothing wrong with one asking his wife for sexual intercourse during daytime or at any other time, even if she is preoccupied with something that could be postponed because a man might be overcome by lust and the delay might cause him harm in his body, or in his heart and sight.\nIt also denotes how the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) taught his Companions the way of ridding the devil's whispers by going for what is lawful instead of what is unlawful.."}, {"number": 479, "hadith": "Salamah ibn al-Akwa\u2018 reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) allowed the Mut\u2018ah marriage (temporary marriage) for three days in the year of Awt\u0101s, then he forbade it..", "commentary": "Islam has established the legal marriage system to protect the progeny and people's honor.

The Mut\u2018ah marriage is a fixed-term marriage, with the word \"tamattu\u2018\" (enjoyment) verbally stated, in return for an amount of money.

However, he forbade them from it during their stay and residence in their countries. The ruling of the Mut\u2018ah marriage passed through various phases, as the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade them from it more than once, then he ordered them to engage in it at various times until he made it permanently forbidden. Forbidding the Mut\u2018ah marriage was reported in many narrations, which point out that the prohibition was in the Conquest of Makkah, which is the most famous opinion, or in the Battle of Awt\u0101s, or in the Battle of Khaybar, or during the Prophet's last days in the Farewell Hajj.

Since he himself is forbidden from getting married during the period of Ihr\u0101m; therefore, he is not to give someone in marriage during this period. Also, he should not \"get engaged,\" as this involves hinting at a proposal of marriage. The secret behind such a prohibition is the fact that the Muhrim has engaged in an act of worship that takes up most of his time, so he must not be occupied with anything else that is not consistent with the state of such an act of worship. Allah has forbidden Rafath - which is sexual intercourse with women and what leads to it - while performing Hajj and its relevant acts, for marriage during the state of Ihr\u0101m calls one to commit Rafath.

This signals that a man should usually look at the face and hands, as her beauty can be recognized from the face, and the tenderness of her body can be known through her hands. The looking should happen before betrothal, lest it will be hard for her if he decides to retract his proposal, in case he does not like her.\nThe Prophet's instruction serves a great interest. There may be something in the woman that would badly affect the continuity of their relationship after marriage, and he can identify it by looking at her, so he will leave her before the consummation of marriage; this would be lighter, simpler, and easier than consummating the marriage and divorcing her after that.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that a man should look at his fianc\u00e9e before marrying her.\nIt points out the excellence of the pure Shariah and its perfect guidelines, as it takes into consideration the interests of people by which their livelihood can be set in order in this world and the Hereafter without undergoing regret and sorrow over what was missed.."}, {"number": 491, "hadith": "Abu Salamah ibn \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n reported:  I asked \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah: \"How much was the Sad\u0101q (dowry) paid by the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him)?\" She said: \"His dowry for his wives was twelve \u2019Uqiyyahs and one Nashsh. Do you know what the Nashsh is?\" I said: \"No.\" She said: \"It is a half \u2019Uqiyyah, so this equals five hundred dirhams, and it was the dowry that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) paid to his wives.\".", "commentary": "Sad\u0101q is the dowry and the money paid to the woman when getting married. Allah Almighty has made it a right that is due to the woman. Allah Almighty says: {Give women their marriage dowries graciously.} [Surat an-Nis\u0101\u2019: 4]\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Abu Salamah ibn \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n reports that he asked the Mother of the Believers, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her): How much was the dowry paid by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to his wives? She told him that it was twelve \u2019Uqiyyahs and one Nashsh. The \u2019Uqiyyah is forty dirhams, and the dirham refers to a coin made of pure silver, and one \u2019Uqiyyah is equal to 28.35 grams. The Nashsh is half a Uqiyyah. So, the dowry paid by the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to his wives was five hundred dirhams. It means that this is what the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) mostly paid to his wives, simply because Al-Bukh\u0101ri narrated that the dowry of Safiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) was emancipating her, and likewise the dowry of Juwayriyah bint al-H\u0101rith was emancipating her. Moreover, An-Naj\u0101shi paid four thousand dirhams to Umm Hab\u012bbah (may Allah be pleased with her) when he gave her in marriage to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). And no mention was made about the dowry of Zaynab bint Jahsh. So, the dowry does not have to be something specific; rather, it depends on everybody's ability and capability.."}, {"number": 492, "hadith": "Anas reported:  When the waiting period of Zaynab was over, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to Zayd: \"Make mention of me to her.\" He said: \"Zayd went off until he came to her while she was fermenting her flour.\" He said: When I saw her, I felt her greatness in my chest, so much that I could not look at her; that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) made mention of her. So, I turned my back toward her and turned upon my heels. I said: \"O Zaynab, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) has sent a message making mention of you.\" She said: \"I will not do anything until I consult my Lord.\" So, she stood at her place of worship, and the Qur\u2019an was revealed.

He said: I recall when the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) served us bread and meat at midday. Then, the people went out, and some men remained talking in the house after the meal. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went out, and I followed him. He began to go to his wives' rooms and greet them, and they would say: \"O Messenger of Allah, how did you find your wife?\" He said: I do not know whether I told him that the people had come out or he told me. He said: He moved on until he entered the house, and I went to enter with him. Thereupon, he placed the curtain between me and him, and the Hijab was sent down. He said: The people were preached by the preaching they received. He added in another version: {O you who believe, do not enter the houses of the Prophet unless you are given permission for a meal; not so early as to wait for the meal to be prepared... but Allah is not shy of [telling] the truth.} [Surat al-Ahz\u0101b: 53].", "commentary": "Zaynab bint Jahsh, the Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her), was the daughter of Umaymah bint 'Abdul-Muttalib, the paternal aunt of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had married Zaynab off to his freed slave Zayd ibn H\u0101rithah (may Allah be pleased with him), whom the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had adopted before Allah prohibited adoption. However, Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her) saw herself as superior to Zayd, and they used to have such disputes between spouses until Zayd divorced her.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Anas ibn M\u0101lik (may Allah be pleased with him) informs that when the divorce waiting period of Zaynab bint Jahsh (may Allah be pleased with her) came to an end, after Zayd ibn H\u0101rithah (may Allah be pleased with him) divorced her; and the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) advised Zayd regarding his wife before he divorced her, as revealed in the verse that reads: {And [remember, O Prophet] when you were saying to the one who was favored by Allah and favored by you: \"Keep your wife and fear Allah.\"} [Surat al-Ahz\u0101b: 37] And in the other part of the verse, Allah Almighty said to His Prophet: {and you were fearing people, while it was more fitting that you should fear Allah. When Zayd no longer desired her, We gave her to you in marriage.} Allah Almighty informed His Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) that Zayd would divorce Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with both of them) and that she would be his wife after Zayd divorced her. He, however, concealed that within himself, fearing that the hypocrites might defame him and spread rumors to the effect that he forbade that a man should marry the wife of his son, and he married the wife of Zayd, who used to be called Zayd ibn Muhammad before that was forbidden and adoption was abolished.\nThen Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) informed that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him): \"make mention of me to her\" i.e., go and propose marriage to her on my behalf and mention me in her presence and say that I want to propose to her. Zayd left and reached her and saw her \"fermenting her flour\" i.e., preparing her dough for baking. Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him) informed that when his sight fell on her, he found it hard to look at her, as the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) wanted to propose to her. He treated her like the mothers of the believers and averted his gaze from her and turned his back toward her. He stepped backward and stood some distance away from her. This happened before Hijab was prescribed in the Qur\u2019an.\nThen Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him) told her that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) sent him to propose marriage to her on his behalf. Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her) told him that she would not give any response until she consulted her Lord and waited to see what Allah would do regarding her matter. So, she stood at her praying place in the house to offer the Istikh\u0101rah (consultation) prayer and \"the Qur\u2019an was revealed\" i.e., the verses in Surat al-Ahz\u0101b were revealed. Then the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came to Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her) and entered her place without seeking permission, as she became his wife after Allah Almighty married her off to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) from above seven heavens.\nThen Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said that he remembered when the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had served them bread and meat in the wedding banquet for his marriage to Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her). All this happened when it was midday and the heat of the sun became intense. Those who ate from the banquet went out and there remained some people who engaged in talking within the house of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came out and left them in the house, talking. Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) came out after him because he was his servant and would always accompany him. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went to the houses of his wives to check on them and learn about their conditions, and the Prophet's wives would ask him: \"O Messenger of Allah, how did you find your wife?\" In a version narrated by Al-Bukh\u0101ri, it was \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who asked the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), saying: \"How did you find your wife? May Allah bless you.\" It is said: She said that by way of jesting. But it is more likely that she intended supplication for the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to be blessed in his family and to be rest assured about them. In a version narrated by Muslim, the reply of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was: 'Fine.'\nThen Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) informed that he could not remember: Was he the one who told the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) that the people, who had lingered and engaged in talking after the banquet, did leave, or it was the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) who told him about that? When the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) became sure that they had come out of the house, he quickly went and entered the house of Zaynab. Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) intended to enter with him, as usual, but the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) put a curtain between the two of them; this was because the verses on Hijab in Surat al-Ahz\u0101b were revealed: {O you who believe, do not enter the houses of the Prophet unless you are given permission for a meal; not so early as to wait for the meal to be prepared. But if you are invited, then enter, and when you have eaten, then disperse, without lingering for conversation. Such [behavior] causes annoyance to the Prophet; he is too shy to express it to you, but Allah is not shy of [telling] the truth.} [Surat al-Ahz\u0101b: 53]\nAnas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"The people were preached by the preaching they received\", i.e., they complied with the command of Allah, the Glorified and Exalted, and the statement of His Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and they came to know the error they committed as they stayed for long in the house of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and engaged in conversation.\nThe Had\u012bth points out the merit of Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her).\nIt indicates that a person should entrust his affairs to Allah Almighty in all his conditions.\nIt demonstrates the modesty of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\nIt urges performance of the Istikh\u0101rah prayer before undertaking any matter.\nIt also urges checking on one's family to rest assured about them.."}, {"number": 493, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah reported  that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"If any of you is invited, let him accept the invitation. If he is fasting, let him pray (for the inviter); if he is not fasting, let him eat.\".", "commentary": "A manifestation of tolerance of Islam is taking into consideration solidarity and affection between people. Hence, it encourages responding to the inviter and deems it one of the rights that the Muslim owes to his brother, all for the sake of having a society where the spirit of love, brotherhood, solidarity, and coherence prevails.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informs us that if one is invited for food - whether a banquet or something else - by his Muslim brother, he must accept the invitation and go. If one who received the food invitation happens to be fasting, whether it be a voluntary fast, a missed fast, or a vow; since the inviter would not have invited him if it had been an obligatory fast during Ramad\u0101n, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) guides the fasting person to clarify his status in another version of Muslim, saying: \"Let him say: I am fasting\" as an apology to the inviter and a way of informing him that he is fasting and cannot eat his food. \"Let him pray,\" i.e., let him pray for the house dwellers to be granted goodness and blessings and let him engage in supplicating for them. Let him also inform his Muslim brother, who invited him, that his abstention is only because of fasting and not because he does not want to eat his food. It was the Arabs' habit to abstain from eating the food of the one towards whom they held evil intentions. If the person invited is not fasting, then let him eat from the food.\nThe Had\u012bth signifies a command to accept the invitation for food.\nIt also encourages supplicating for the food providers (the host).."}, {"number": 494, "hadith": "Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"Verily, one of the most important trusts in the sight of Allah on the Day of Judgment is a man who is intimate with his wife, and she is intimate with him, and then he divulges her secret.\" Ibn Numayr said: [Another version reads]: Verily, the most important..", "commentary": "Having a healthy marital relationship and seeking love and mercy are among the means of protecting this bond and this pledge that Allah has made solemn and has described as being solemn given its strength and significance.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) says that the most serious breach, betrayal, and violation of trust, and the gravest in terms of punishment in the sight of Allah on the Day of Judgment, the day of recompense, is the man's betrayal to his wife. \"a man who is intimate with his wife, and she is intimate with him\" is an indirect reference to sexual intercourse and physical contact between the spouses, i.e., everything related to marital secrets and what each spouse entrusts to the other. Then after this, the man divulges her secret, i.e., the hidden physical defects. It could also mean describing what occurs between the spouses regarding the enjoyment and what the woman says or does during the intercourse. In fact, this is a severe threat and a warning for one who reveals his spouse's secret. The advice is addressed to both spouses along with the warning against divulging each other's secrets. Thus, the man must not reveal her secret and vice versa. However, he mentioned one of them - the husband - to refer to the other, or he made no mention of the wife divulging her husband's secret because the woman, in principle, tends to conceal and hide whatever is indecent and she rarely does this because of her bashfulness, unlike the man who is expected to do this.."}, {"number": 495, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h reported:  A man asked the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), saying: \"I have a slave-girl and I practice coitus interruptus with her.\" The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Indeed, this would not prevent something willed by Allah.\" He said: The man came and said: \"O Messenger of Allah, the slave-girl I mentioned to you has become pregnant.\" Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"I am the servant and Messenger of Allah.\".", "commentary": "All the destinies of created beings lie in the Hand of Allah alone.

Coitus interruptus is practiced by removing the male sex organ out of the woman's vulva before ejaculation, and the man ejaculates outside the vulva, to prevent pregnancy. Replying to him, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Indeed, this would not prevent something willed by Allah.\" The meaning: Indeed, if Allah Almighty predestined the creation of a soul, it would surely be created; and that the fluid and semen may outrun you, and you cannot stop it, and your keenness in this regard would not avail you. The semen could quickly come out without the man practicing coitus interruptus feeling it to execute what Allah predestined. There is no soul determined in the knowledge of Allah Almighty that it will be born except that it will exist in reality, whether coitus interruptus is practiced or not. Likewise, ejaculation may happen inside, and no pregnancy takes place. So, coitus interruptus and ejaculation inside are alike in terms of the fact that pregnancy can only happen by Allah's predestination.\nThen, after some time, that man came to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and spoke to him about this slave-girl with whom he had practiced coitus interruptus and told him that she got pregnant. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"I am the servant and Messenger of Allah\" i.e., what I say to you is true; so, adopt it and be certain of it, for indeed it will surely come to pass.\nThe Had\u012bth shows the keenness of the Companions in learning the matters of their religion from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).."}, {"number": 496, "hadith": "Abu ad-Dard\u0101\u2019 reported:  The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came across a woman in the advanced stage of pregnancy at the door of a tent, and he said: \"Perhaps he wants to copulate with her.\" They said: 'Yes.' Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"I resolved to curse him with a curse that would enter his grave with him. How would he be his heir while this is not lawful for him?! And how would he employ him while this is not lawful for him?!\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to forbid his Companions from unlawful things and all that Allah, the Exalted and Glorified, prohibited. He would sometimes do so by encouraging them to obtain the reward with Allah Almighty and other times by intimidating them from the penalty and punishment of Allah.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Abu ad-Dard\u0101\u2019 (may Allah be pleased with him) informs that while the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was on a journey, he passed by a woman in the advanced stage of pregnancy. She was one of the captives and was sitting at the door of a tent. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to her: \"Perhaps he\", meaning her owner and master who obtained her as his share of the captives. \"wants to copulate with her\" i.e., wants to engage in sexual intercourse with her. However, it is not lawful for the master of a pregnant captive to copulate with her until she gives birth. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said that he resolved and intended to supplicate against him to be turned away from Allah's mercy and for that to continue after his death. He (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) intended to curse him because he failed to ascertain the emptiness of her womb, for if he copulates with his captive whom he owns while she is pregnant from someone else, he is thus neglecting to ascertain the emptiness of her womb. However, the cursing did not take place because this man was not aware of the ruling.\nHis words: \"How would he be his heir while this is not lawful for him\" means that this slave-girl captive may give birth after six months, and thus, the baby is likely from this captor, and it is likely from someone before him. So, if he is from the captor, then he is his child, and they may inherit from each other; and if he is from someone else, then he and the captor may not inherit from each other, given the lack of blood relationship.\nThen, he said: \"And how would he employ him,\" i.e., the child? If he employs him as a slave, it is probable that he came from him, and thus, he will be enslaving his child and cutting off his own lineage, and for this, he will be worthy of cursing. And if he attributes the baby to himself as his child, it is likely that he did not come from him, and thus he will be making him his heir, whereas he is not his heir, and for this, he will be worthy of cursing.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that captivity nullifies previous ownership and dissolves marriage.\nIt also indicates that when there is a new owner of a female slave, it becomes due to ascertain the emptiness of her womb. So, he may not copulate with her until her womb is verified to be empty of pregnancy.\nIt also points out that it is forbidden to copulate with a pregnant captive until she gives birth.."}, {"number": 497, "hadith": "Jud\u0101mah bint Wahb - sister of \u2018Ukk\u0101shah - reported: I was there when the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to some people:  \"I was about to forbid Gh\u012blah (sexual intercourse during the breastfeeding period), so I considered that the Romans and the Persians do it without any harm done to their children thereby.\" Then they asked him about coitus interruptus, and the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"That is the hidden Wa\u2019d (burying a child alive).\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was keen on benefiting the believers and showed sympathy and concern for them. He left nothing that could be of benefit to them without guiding them to it and ordering them to do it.

The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"I was about to,\" i.e., I was determined to forbid \"Gh\u012blah\", which is having intercourse with one's wife during her breastfeeding period, or a woman's conception during the breastfeeding period. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was determined to forbid it because there was a popular belief at that time that it was harmful to the infant. They used to say that if the breastfeeding woman had sexual intercourse with her husband and conceived during her breastfeeding period, her milk would be spoilt and the child would get weak if he fed on it, and the Arabs would hate and avoid him. However, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) saw that the Romans and the Persians - two great kingdoms at that time - did this without worrying about it, besides the fact that it did not cause their children any harm; so, he did not forbid it.\nThen, the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) asked him about the ruling on coitus interruptus, which means removing the man's penis from the woman's vagina before ejaculation and ejaculating outside the vagina to avoid conception. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"That is the hidden Wa\u2019d,\" considering the coitus interruptus hidden burial of a child alive because it entails wasting the sperm that Allah Almighty has prepared to be a child. So, it resembles killing a child by burying him alive. However, there is no doubt that it is less grave, and this is why he said it is hidden.\nIn the Two Sah\u012bh Collections, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to those who asked him about the coitus interruptus: \"It does not matter if you do not do it, for every soul that is to be born up to the Day of Judgment will be born,\" i.e., no soul to exist in the knowledge of Allah Almighty except that it will come to exist, whether the coitus interruptus is done or not. Despite the coitus interruptus, there could be a small amount of semen ejaculated which Allah destined to form a child, and on the other hand, there could be normal ejaculation without conception. In short, coitus interruptus or normal ejaculation are equal as both do not lead to having a child except by Allah's decree.."}, {"number": 498, "hadith": "\u2018\u0100mir ibn Sa\u2018d reported:  that Us\u0101mah ibn Zayd informed his father Sa\u2018d ibn Abi Waqq\u0101s that a man came to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and said: \"I practice coitus interruptus with my wife.\" The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: \"Why do you do that?\" The man said: \"I fear for her child - or for her children.\" Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"If this was harmful, it would harm the Persians and the Romans.\" [In a version]: \"If it was for that, then no.

The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked him: For what reason do you do this act? The man said: \"I fear for her child\", who suckles from her. This is because if she gets pregnant, her milk will be spoiled, and the body of the baby will become unsound and weak. Or he meant the famous notion among the Arabs that copulation damages milk and that such milk will be a malady and if the baby drinks it, he will become ill. So, he feared that he would be thin and unwell. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: \"If this was harmful\" - copulation or pregnancy during the period of suckling - \"it would harm the Persians and the Romans\", for the women of the Persians and the Romans suckle their babies while they are pregnant. So, if pregnancy or copulation during the period of suckling was harmful, it would harm their children.

Second: That which is abrogated in terms of recitation apart from its ruling. Third: That which is abrogated in terms of ruling apart from its recitation. The first two types of abrogation are found in this Had\u012bth. (Ten times of known breastfeeding prohibits) was abrogated both in terms of ruling and recitation, whereas the five times of breastfeeding was abrogated in terms of recitation only and its ruling has remained.\nThe statement of \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her): \"The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) died while these (words of the abrogating verse) were still being recited as part of the Qur\u2019an\" meaning: The abrogation by the five times of breastfeeding was revealed at a very late stage to the extent that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) died while some people were still reciting the part of the five times of breastfeeding as part of the Qur\u2019an because of not being aware of that recent abrogation. Later, when they learned about the abrogation, they stopped reciting it and unanimously agreed that it should not be recited.."}, {"number": 501, "hadith": "Zaynab bint Abi Salamah reported:  I heard' Umm Salamah, the Prophet's wife, say to '\u0100\u2019ishah: By Allah, I do not feel comfortable to be seen by a boy who has passed the age of suckling. She said: Why? Sahlah bint Suhayl came to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and said: \"O Messenger of Allah, by Allah, I see (displeasure) on the face of Abu Hudhayfah because of S\u0101lim entering.\" She said: Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Suckle him.\" She said: \"He has a beard.\" He said: \"Suckle him, and what is on the face of Abu Hudhayfah will go away.\" She said: \"By Allah, I did not see it on the face of Abu Hudhayfah.\".", "commentary": "In this Had\u012bth, Zaynab bint Abi Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) informs that she heard her mother' Umm Salamah, the Prophet's wife, swearing to '\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) and saying: \"By Allah, I do not feel comfortable\" i.e., I do not like it; \"to be seen by a boy\" from non-Mahram (unrelated) males \"who has passed the age of suckling\" i.e., he is no longer in need of suckling. Thereupon, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah said to \u2019Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with both of them): \"Why?\" i.e., why are you saying this, whereas there is nothing wrong with that if you suckle him or he is suckled by someone who makes him a Mahram (related and non-marriageable) to you? This is evidenced by the fact that \"Sahlah bint Suhayl\", the wife of Abu Hudhayfah, came to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and swore to him that she would see dislike on the face of Abu Hudhayfah because of their foster son S\u0101lim continuing to enter the house as he would usually do when he was young, and he now reached adulthood - particularly after verses had been revealed prohibiting adoption. Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to her: \"Suckle him\" to be your son by suckling. She said to him: \"He has a beard\" for he is an adult man. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to her: \"Suckle him and what is on the face of Abu Hudhayfah will go away\" i.e., the sign of dislike will vanish from him. Sahlah did so and then she swore that she did not find the sign of dislike on the face of Abu Hudhayfah after she had suckled him.\nThis Had\u012bth is problematic in terms of explaining it and deriving rulings therefrom, and difference of opinion actually arose over it among the Prophet's wives. \u2019Umm Salamah and some of the Prophet's wives believed that this was a dispensation from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to the wife of Abu Hudhayfah alone, and they held that there should be no suckling for adults and that the suckling that makes a person a Mahram is the one provided in young age and which grows the bones and builds the body and flesh.\nAs for \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), she - as reported here - held that suckling causes prohibition of the same things made prohibited by blood relations, whether the suckled one is a child or an adult. She cited as evidence the story of S\u0101lim, the freed slave of Abu Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with both of them) and that the ruling is not exclusively restricted to them.\nWhat appears to be right - and Allah knows best - is that suckling of adults does not count, has no effect, and causes no prohibition, and that true suckling is that which occurs during babyhood; and what happened in the story of S\u0101lim is particularly restricted to him and does not apply to anyone other than him. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) affirmed that not every suckling causes prohibition. In a Had\u012bth in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections, he said: \"Indeed, suckling is from hunger\" i.e., the suckling that counts is the one that occurs at the time when milk is relied upon for food and in the amounts that affect the growth of the baby's body.\nThe Had\u012bth points out that suckling causes prohibition of the same things made prohibited by blood relations.\nIt demonstrates that there is a difference of opinion regarding the suckling of adults and its resultant effects.."}, {"number": 502, "hadith": "Zaynab bint Abi Salamah reported that her mother \u2019Umm Salamah, the Prophet's wife, reported:  The other wives of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) refused to let anyone privately enter their houses by such suckling.

An exception was \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who held the view that such suckling makes marriage unlawful like suckling during babyhood. They swore to \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) and said: \"By Allah, we do not see this except as a dispensation which the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) gave to S\u0101lim\", the freed slave of Abu Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him), \"in particular\"; not generally for everyone. Therefore, we will not let anyone enter our houses or see us by such suckling.\nThe dispensation which the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) gave to S\u0101lim in particular is mentioned in a Had\u012bth narrated by Muslim in his Sah\u012bh Collection, in which \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported: that S\u0101lim, the freed slave of Abu Hudhayfah, was with Abu Hudhayfah and his family in their house. His wife Sahlah the daughter of Suhayl came to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and said: \"S\u0101lim has reached the age of manhood and understands what men understand. He enters our house, and I think that Abu Hudhayfah is not comfortable with that.\" Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to her: \"Suckle him and what Abu Hudhayfah feels will go away.\" She returned and said: \"Indeed, I suckled him, and what Abu Hudhayfah felt went away.\"\nIt is reported in a Had\u012bth narrated by Abu D\u0101w\u016bd that \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) would ask the daughters of her sisters and brothers to suckle whomever she liked to enter her house - even if he was an adult - five times, and then he would enter her house. However, \u2019Umm Salamah and the other wives of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) refused to let anyone enter their houses by such suckling unless the suckling occurred in the cradle. Hence, the statements and attitudes of other wives of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) constituted evidence that the suckling of an adult does not count, has no weight, and does not establish the unlawfulness of marriage; and that true suckling happens in babyhood, and what happened in the story of S\u0101lim is an exceptional peculiarity that was limited to him and does not apply to anyone else. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) emphasized that not every suckling makes marriage unlawful. In a Had\u012bth in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections, he said: \"Indeed, suckling is from hunger\" i.e., the suckling that counts is the one that occurs at the time when milk is relied upon for food and in the amounts that affect the growth of the baby's body.."}, {"number": 503, "hadith": "Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Khudri reported:  that at the battle of Hunayn, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) sent an army to Awt\u0101s.

Some of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon them) seemed to have refrained from having intercourse with them, as they had husbands among the polytheists. So, Allah Almighty revealed in this regard: {Also [prohibited are] married women except for female slaves you may own} [Surat an-Nis\u0101': 24], i.e., they are lawful for you when their waiting periods come to an end..", "commentary": "The Shariah regulated the religious rulings regarding times of peace and war. Since war results in captives from the men of the enemy and their women, the Qur\u2019an and the Sunnah clarified the rulings concerning them. It prohibited copulation with pregnant and married female captives until they gave birth or until non-pregnant captives were verified to be non-pregnant by having menses.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) informs that during the battle of Hunayn - which took place in the eighth Hijri year, after the Conquest of Makkah, between the Muslims and the people of T\u0101\u2019if among the two tribes of Haw\u0101zin and Thaq\u012bf, in a valley called Hunayn, which is situated between Makkah and T\u0101\u2019if; as the disbelievers had gone out with their property, women, and children; and after Haw\u0101zin and Thaq\u012bf were defeated and Allah granted victory to His Prophet and the Muslims, the fleeing disbelievers withdrew to the valley of Awt\u0101s, which is close to Hunayn - the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) sent an army to them, and they encountered an enemy from the disbelievers, whom they fought, overcame, and defeated. Among their spoils were captives from the polytheist women. Some of the Prophet's Companions refrained - out of fear of committing a sin - from having intercourse with them because they were married women, and a married woman is not lawful for anyone other than her husband. So, they thought that their marriage to their husbands was not severed. Therefore, Allah Almighty revealed verses demonstrating the ruling on copulation with those they refrained from: {Also [prohibited are] married women except for female slaves you may own.} [Surat an-Nis\u0101\u2019: 24] i.e., prohibited for you is marrying married women, except for the women you possess by taking them into captivity, as their marriage to their disbelieving husbands is dissolved. They become lawful for you after their wombs are verified to be empty of the semen of the disbelieving husbands, either by childbirth, in case the woman is pregnant, or by one menstrual period, if she is not pregnant.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates that the marriage of polytheists is dissolved if their wives are taken captive, as they go into the ownership of their captors.\nIt shows how a person should pause, search, and ask about any matter when he is not certain of the reason behind it and its ruling.

So, he said to her: \"You are not humbled in the estimation of your husband\" i.e., you will not be underestimated and your right will not be lost at all.

After spending three days with her, he wanted to leave her house for the house of another one of his wives; however, she took hold of his garment so he would stay with her.

In other words: I extend my stay and the rest of my wives become entitled to the same number of days. Then, he informed her that a virgin wife - who had not been previously married - was entitled to seven nights than his other wives if he had sexual intercourse with her; whereas the Thayyib - who had been previously married - was entitled to three days.\nIn another Had\u012bth narrated by Muslim, when the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) married \u2019Umm Salamah and she stayed with him (during the night), he said to her: \"Indeed, you are not inferior in the sight of your family,\" i.e., you will not be underestimated, and none of your right will be lost; rather, you will take it in full. He then gave her the choice to stay for three days with her without having to make up for them or to stay for seven days with her and make it up for the rest of his wives. The three have the privilege of not having to make up for them, while the seven have the privilege of being successive and fulfilling perfect intimacy. ' Umm Salamah said: \"Stay three,\" so she chose the three because they were not to be made up for, and he would, thus, return to her sooner since he would spend the night with them in turn then come to her. However, if she had chosen seven, he would not return to her except after making it up (days) for his other wives, and he would, thus, be far from her for a long time.\nThe virgin is exclusively granted seven days given her shyness, which requires extra time, patience, sensibleness, and gentleness, besides the fact that one feels inclined to stay longer with her so that he can stay with her for up to seven days in a row. On the other hand, the previously married woman had already experienced marriage, and her need for intimacy is lesser, besides the fact that one is less attached to her than to the virgin. However, given that she is not familiar yet with the company, she is honored by extending the stay, which is three.

This wording is meant to encourage and promote adherence to the command or the prohibition mentioned in the Had\u012bth. \"If he witnesses something\" in general, whether between two, a group, or the like, and there is a need for him to speak about it, then let him consider it carefully; if there is goodness in his words, then he should speak, or else he should keep silent.\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to advise men to treat their wives kindly in compliance with the commands of Islam. Given the fact that women are originally created with crookedness, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) drew attention to that saying: \"Take care of women\" with the following addition in Al-Bukh\u0101ri version: \"good care\", i.e., advise each other to treat them kindly. \"For the woman was created from a rib,\" which is one of the chest bones. In other words, there is crookedness in their original creation. \"And the most crooked part of the rib is its top\", this description is meant as an exaggeration in describing such crookedness and to emphasize the probability of breaking because the difficulty of straightening the top is apparent. It is said: Perhaps this is meant to refer to the woman's upper part that has her head and tongue, from where the crookedness springs. It is also said: That the form of \"A\u2018waj\" (crooked) here is meant as a description not to indicate preference, as colors and defects do not have forms indicating preference. If you try to straighten the rib and make it straight, it will break. Similarly, if you want a woman to be perfectly straight in morals, this will lead to breaking her, which is divorcing her. as mentioned in Muslim's version. \"And if you leave it, it will remain crooked\" as it was originally created, so it is impossible to straighten it. This is set as an example of the crookedness in women's morals; if sought to be upright, this could lead to divorce. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"So, take good care of women,\" i.e.; there is no way except enduring this crookedness patiently. Hence, this should be tolerated with patience, and women should be treated benevolently and kindly.\nOr it could be referring to gentle redress; refraining from exaggeration that leads to breaking and from negligence that leads to persistence in crookedness. To sum up, he should not neglect her crookedness if she exceeds her natural deficiency level by committing sins or abandoning duties; however, what is meant is that he should neglect her crookedness regarding what is permissible.\nThe Had\u012bth implies guidance to maintaining one's tongue and protecting it from idle talk.\nIt also sheds light on the importance of appeasement in attracting souls and winning hearts.\nMoreover, it shows how women could be handled through pardon and patience with their crookedness.."}, {"number": 510, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"Let not a believing man hate a believing woman. If he dislikes one of her characteristics, he will be pleased with another - Or he said: another one.\".", "commentary": "Faith calls to noble morals. Thus, no believing man or woman is free from good manners, as faith requires the existence of praiseworthy qualities in them.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) says: \"Let not a believing man Yafrak a believing woman,\" and \"fark\" means hatred and dislike. The \"believing man\" and the \"believing woman\" here refer to the husband and wife. It was said: This is a form of negation that denotes prohibition, i.e., she must not be totally hated. It was also said: It is a prohibition, i.e., the husband must not absolutely hate his wife in such a way that leads to oppressing, abandoning, and turning away from her. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) explained this by saying that if the husband hates a bad quality in her, he will find another quality that pleases him. She could be rude but at the same time religious, pretty, chaste, or kind to him, or the like. So, he approves of this good quality that suits him and, thus, faces what he dislikes about her with what he likes about her. In this way, what he likes of her good qualities will help him patiently endure what he dislikes of her bad qualities. So, he forgives the bad for the sake of the good and overlooks what he dislikes for the sake of what he likes. And in this way, he will not absolutely hate her to the extent that he breaks up with her.\nThe Had\u012bth encourages good treatment and companionship.."}, {"number": 511, "hadith": "Ibn \u2018Umar reported that he divorced his wife during her menstruation in the Prophet's lifetime. So, \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b asked the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) about that and the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"Order him to take her back and keep her until she attains purity, then menstruates, then attains purity. Then, if he wishes he may keep her, and if he wishes he may divorce her before having intercourse with her. This is the \u2018Iddah (waiting period) that Allah Almighty has ordered for the divorce of women.\" [Another version reads]: That he divorced his wife during her menstruation, once. So, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanded him to take her back and keep her until she attains purity, then menstruates again, while still being with him, then to give her time until she attains purity from her menstruation. After that, if he wanted to divorce her, he could do so when she becomes pure before having sexual intercourse with her, as this is the \u2018iddah that Allah commanded for the divorce of women. [Another version reads]: On being asked about this, \u2018Abdullah said to someone: \"If you divorced your wife once or twice, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanded me to do this. However, if you have divorced her thrice, she became forbidden to you until she is married to another man, and you have disobeyed Allah regarding what He commanded you in divorcing your wife.\".", "commentary": "The legislated divorce is that one divorces his wife one time while being pure (of her menses) without having sexual intercourse with her during this period of purity. It is called Tal\u0101q Sunni (Sunnah-compliant divorce). As for the forbidden divorce, it is to divorce one's wife more than once in one utterance, or to divorce her during her menstruation, or during a period of purity in which he had sexual intercourse with her. This is called Tal\u0101q Bid\u2018i (Heretic divorce).\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) narrates that he divorced his wife - her name was \u0100minah bint Ghif\u0101r, and it was said: \u0100minah bint \u2018Amm\u0101r, and there are other opinions as well - during her menstruation before attaining purity, and that was in the Prophet's lifetime. His father, \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b, went to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and asked him about the ruling on this divorce that occurred during menstruation, whether it is permissible or not, and whether it counts or not. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanded him to order his son, \u2018Abdullah, to take her back in marriage and keep her with him \"until she attains purity\" from the menstruation in which he divorced her, \"then menstruates\" again, \"then attains purity\" from the second menstruation. After attaining purity from the second menstruation, he could keep her as his wife if he wished or he could divorce her in the second period of purity before having intercourse with her. This state, namely the state of purity, is the time for starting \"the \u2018Iddah that Allah Almighty has commanded for the divorce,\" i.e., during which, \"women\", as Allah Almighty says: {O Prophet, when you [believers] divorce women, divorce them with concern to their waiting period.} [Surat at-Tal\u0101q: 1] That is to say, divorce them while receiving their \u2018Iddah, i.e., at the time they could start the \u2018Iddah, and the period of menstruation is not counted in the \u2018Iddah. So, if one divorces during this time, his divorce does not occur in the state commanded by Allah, which is starting and entering the \u2018Iddah, when the divorce occurs during the period of her purity not during the period of her menstruation. This is because, during the purity period, she can keep an accurate count of her \u2018Iddah, which is three Qur\u016b\u2019 (menstrual cycles), and \"qur\u2019\" is purity, and it was said: menstruation.\nIn another version, Muhammad ibn Rumh - one of the Had\u012bth narrators - added: Whenever \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Umar was asked about divorcing a woman during menstruation, he would say to the questioner: If you divorced your wife once or twice then take her back, as the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanded me to do so. However, if you divorced her thrice then this is an irrevocable divorce and you cannot take her back and she becomes forbidden for you \"until she is married to another man,\" and he has sexual intercourse with her and then divorces her. After her \u2018Iddah is over, she becomes lawful for you again to marry.\nAnd by doing this, you disobeyed Allah and went against Him \"regarding what He commanded you in divorcing your wife\" during the purity state in which you had intercourse with her, as Allah Almighty says: {O Prophet, when you [believers] divorce women, divorce them with concern to their waiting period.} [Surat at-Tal\u0101q: 1]\nThis clarifies that the divorce counts, whether it is Sunni or Bid\u2018i. The fact that the Bid\u2018i divorce is forbidden does not entail that it does not occur. It only means that whoever does this deliberately is considered sinful, yet the divorce still counts.\nIn a version of Muslim, Anas ibn S\u012br\u012bn said to Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father): \"Was that divorce that you gave her when she was menstruating counted as such?\" and you considered it one of the three divorces. \"\u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Umar said: Why would I not count it? (It must be counted) even if I failed and acted foolishly,\" i.e, failed to fulfill an obligation or acted foolishly and did not fulfill it, or failed to take her back and acted foolishly. Would that be an excuse for him, or would his foolishness make it not count, or would his failure invalidate it?! It is a question of disapproval whose answer is supposed to be: Yes, it is counted, and his failure and foolishness do not prevent it from being counted.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates the keenness of Islam to restrict the circumference of divorce as much as possible, and if it happens, it does not cause harm to any of the spouses.\nIt also indicates that the husband alone has the right to Raj\u2018ah (taking the wife back) without the guardian.."}, {"number": 512, "hadith": "Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s reported:  The triple divorce during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and that of Abu Bakr and two years of the caliphate of \u2018Umar was counted as one. Then \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b said: \"Indeed, people have hastened to a matter regarding which they used to act with deliberation. So, if we would make them count (as three divorces),\" and he did that..", "commentary": "Allah Almighty has made divorce a kind of respite between the spouses when life between them becomes impossible. In Islam, divorce has certain criteria and results in a number of rights.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him) narrates: During the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and that of Abu Bakr and two years of \u2018Umar's caliphate, whoever triply divorced his wife in one session or in one time, would count as a single divorce. An example of this is saying: \"You are divorced thrice,\" or saying: \"You are divorced. You are divorced. You are divorced.\" Then the husband can take his wife back during the period of \u2018Iddah (waiting period) without a new contract. If the \u2018Iddah is over, he can take her back with a new contract. It is not counted as three divorces that would make his wife unlawful for him until she is married to another man. It is deemed to refer to what was most likely meant, which was the intent of confirmation, not for continuing the count. During the lifetime of \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), people used this form frequently while most likely intending to continue the count not by way of confirmation. Hence, \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) made it count as three divorces. He said: \"Indeed, people have hastened to a matter regarding which they used to act with deliberation,\" i.e., they were entitled to three divorces to give themselves a chance to reconsider their affairs, as it might seem better for them to take their wives back. His saying: \"So if we made them count,\" i.e., He consulted those who were with him from the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) regarding the one who gave three divorces all at once to make such a divorce an irrevocable triple divorce as he uttered, to deter them from rushing into divorce. Thus, he enforced it on people after consulting the senior Companions and their agreement with him.\nThis is interpreted from him (may Allah be pleased with him) as a form of Ijtih\u0101d and laying down rules that would bring benefit to his subjects within the boundaries of Shariah, without making things too difficult or too easy.."}, {"number": 513, "hadith": "\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to seek our permission on the day he had to stay with one of his wives (by turns) after the following verse was revealed: {You [O Prophet] may postpone [the turn of] whoever you wish [of your wives], and you may share your time with whoever of them you wish.} [Surat al-Ahz\u0101b: 51] Mu\u2018\u0101dhah said to her: What did you use to say to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) when he asked your permission?

The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had nine wives, and he used to allocate a day for each to stay with her overnight. This act of his seeking permission was after the revelation of the following verse: {You [O Prophet] may postpone [the turn of] whoever you wish [of your wives], and you may share your time with whoever of them you wish, and there is no blame on you if you call back any of those whose turn you have set aside. That is more likely that they will be content and not distressed, and that they will be satisfied with what you give them all. Allah knows what is in your hearts, and Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing.} [Surat al-Ahz\u0101b: 51] This verse means: O Messenger, you have the right to delay the turn of whoever you wish of your wives and not stay overnight with her, and you have the right to share your time with whoever you wish of them and stay overnight with her; and there is no blame on you if you call back any of those whom you have delayed. Giving you the choice and making things flexible for you are more likely to make your wives content and satisfied with what you give them all for knowing that you have not neglected duty and have not withheld a right, and Allah knows what is in your hearts - O men - of inclination to some women apart from others, as Allah is All-Knowing of His slaves' actions and nothing thereof is hidden from Him, and He is Most Forbearing and does not hasten to punish them hoping that they may return to Him in repentance.\nThe female T\u0101bi\u2018i Mu\u2018\u0101dhah al-\u2018Adawiyyah asked \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her): \"What did you use to say to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) when he asked for your permission?\" \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) replied that she used to say to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): \"Were it up to me,\" i.e., if this act of seeking permission is in my hands, \"I would not give anyone preference over myself,\" i.e., I would not give my day to another wife. This was due to her love to be close to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to serve him, enjoy intimacy with him, and benefit from him.\nSuch a competition between his wives was not for mere pleasure, intimacy, personal desires, and enjoyment, as is the case with some people. Instead, it was a competition for matters related to the Hereafter and for being close to the master of the first and the last, for expecting the descent of mercy and revelation upon him while being with her and so on.\nThe Had\u012bth clarifies one of the Prophet's exclusive rights, namely choosing whomever he wished from his wives whenever he wished.\nIt also points out some of the etiquettes between spouses and teaches them how a man should seek his wives' permission when sharing his time with them and how the woman should show him love and affection.."}, {"number": 514, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdullah reported:  Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) came and sought permission to see the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).

Then came \u2018Umar and he sought permission and it was granted to him. He found the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) sitting sad and silent with his wives around him, and said: He said: I would say something that would make the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) laugh.

However, he used to spend often on the cause of Allah and on what would benefit people, leaving only a little for himself and his family. This led to some harm felt by his wives; however, Allah Almighty gave them the choice to either endure life patiently or get a divorce and be separated from him kindly.\nIn this Had\u012bth, J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) narrates: Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) once came and sought permission to see the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and found people sitting at his door and none among them was granted permission to see the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) granted Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) permission and he entered. Then, \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) came to the Prophet's house and sought permission to enter and he permitted him. On entering, \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) found the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) sitting with his wives around him and he was intensely sad, so much so that he stopped talking.

So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) laughed out of the resemblance between his condition and that of \u2018Umar. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"They\", referring to his wives, are sitting \"around me as you see, asking for extra money\" and requesting more money than the usual amount. When the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said this, Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) got up and went to \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) to slap her on the neck by way of discipline. \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) also got up to slap his daughter Hafsah (may Allah be pleased with her) on the neck by way of discipline, and each of them was saying to his daughter: \"Are you asking the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) for what he does not have?!\" It was an expression of rebuke and reprimand for them because of their asking for an extra amount of money while the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not have it. \"They said: By Allah, we would never ask the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him),\" after this \"something that he does not have.\" The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) got angry because of this and he retreated from his wives for thirty or twenty-nine days without entering their houses or approaching them. Then, the following verses were revealed: {O Prophet, tell your wives, \u201cIf you seek the life of this world and its embellishments, then come, I will give you provision and release you graciously. But if you seek Allah and His Messenger and the Final Abode, then Allah has prepared for those who do good among you a great reward.\u201d} [Surat al-Ahz\u0101b: 28-29] The two verses mean: O Prophet, tell your wives when they ask you for an increase in sustenance and you have nothing to give them as an extra amount: If you seek the life of this world and its embellishments, then come I will give you provision that is given to the divorced women and release you in a way that involves no harm or damage. However, if you seek Allah's pleasure and the pleasure of His Messenger, and you seek Paradise in the Final Abode, then endure your conditions patiently, as Allah has prepared for those who do good among you, through patience and good treatment, a great reward.\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) started with \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) in giving her the choice. He called her and informed her that he had something to propound to her and that he wished she would not hasten to give him a reply without consulting her parents. Perhaps this was out of fear for her because of her young age which entailed the desire for worldly embellishments and her not choosing the Hereafter. She asked the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) about that matter and he recited the verse to her, so she hastened to accept being with the Messenger of Allah, and she said: \"Is it concerning you,\" i.e., being separated from you, or staying with you, or regarding your right, \"O Messenger of Allah, that I should consult my parents?!\" And she told him that she chose Allah, His Messenger, and the Final Abode. She also asked him (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) not to tell any of his wives about her reply out of her jealousy and keenness to have the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) all for herself and enjoy a great deal of his company. In response, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"None of them asks me except that I will inform her,\" to help her make her choice. He justified this by saying that Allah did not send him to be harsh, i.e., causing someone to be in a difficult situation and \"\u2018anat\", meaning difficulty and sin as well, \"or cause harm,\" i.e., seek others' mistakes. \"But He sent me to teach\" people goodness and make things easy. Facilitation here lies in the fact that if he informed them, his other wives would follow the example of \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) and it would be easy for them to choose Allah Almighty, His Messenger (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and the Final Abode.\nThis Had\u012bth points out that asking permission is from the Prophet's guidance.\nIt also indicates that one can discipline one's child, even if he grew up.\nIt shows the ascetic life of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and his abstention from worldly life.\nIt also demonstrates how the Companions used to console the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in his sadness.\nIt denotes the merit of Abu Bakr, \u2018Umar, and \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with them).."}, {"number": 515, "hadith": "\u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b reported:  When the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) secluded himself from his wives, he ('Umar) said: I entered the mosque and found the people pelting the ground with pebbles and saying: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) divorced his wives, and that was before they were commanded with Hij\u0101b. \u2018Umar said: I said: I must find this out today.

I called out: O Rab\u0101h, seek permission for me from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Rab\u0101h looked at the room then looked at me and said nothing. Then, I said: O Rab\u0101h, seek permission for me from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Rab\u0101h looked at the room then looked at me and said nothing.

I raised my voice, and he signaled to me to ascend. I entered upon the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) while he was lying on a straw mat. I sat down and he drew up his lower garment over him and he had nothing else on him, and the mat had left marks on his side. I looked around in the cabinet of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and found only a handful of barley around one S\u0101\u2018 and an equal quantity of the leaves of mimosa flava placed in one side of the room, and a semi-tanned leather bag hanging. He said: Tears started falling from my eyes. He said: O Ibn al-Khatt\u0101b, what makes you weep? I said: O Prophet of Allah, how could I not weep when this straw mat has left marks on your side and I see nothing in your cabinet except what I have seen, while Caesar and Khosrau are enjoying fruits and rivers, whereas you are the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and His chosen one and this is your cabinet?! He said: O Ibn al-Khatt\u0101b, does it not please you that the Hereafter is for us and the worldly life is for them? I said: Yes. He said: When I entered upon him, I saw signs of anger on his face, so I said: O Messenger of Allah, what trouble have the women caused you? If you had divorced them, verily, Allah is with you, His angels, Jibr\u012bl (Gabriel), Mik\u0101\u2019\u012bl (Michael), I, Abu Bakr, and the believers are with you. I rarely spoke - thanks to Allah - any words except that I hoped Allah would confirm the words I uttered, and this verse, \u0100yat at-Takhy\u012br (the Verse of Choice), was revealed: {Perhaps, if he were to divorce you all, his Lord would replace you with better wives.} [Surat at-Tahr\u012bm: 5] {But if you insist on conspiring against him, then indeed Allah is his Protector, as well as Gabriel and the righteous believers, and moreover, the angels are his supporters.} [Surat at-Tahr\u012bm: 4] \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah bint Abi Bakr and Hafsah were cooperating against the rest of the Prophet's wives. I said: O Messenger of Allah, did you divorce them? He said: No. I said: O Messenger of Allah, when I entered the mosque, I found the Muslims pelting the ground with pebbles and saying: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) divorced his wives. Should I go down and tell them that you did not divorce them? He said: Yes, if you wish. I kept talking to him until there were no more signs of anger on his face and until he laughed and his teeth showed, and he had the most charming front teeth of all people. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) descended and I descended while catching hold of the trunk, but the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went down as if he was walking on the ground without touching it with his hand. I said: O Messenger of Allah, you remained in your room for twenty-nine days. He said: The month consists of twenty-nine days. I, thus, stood at the door of the mosque and called out at the top of my voice: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not divorce his wives, and this verse was revealed: {Whenever they hear any news of security or fear, they spread it. If they referred it to the Messenger or to those in authority among them, those with sound judgment among them could know it.} [Surat an-Nis\u0101\u2019: 83] And it was I who drew correct conclusions and Allah Almighty revealed the Verse of Choice..", "commentary": "Perhaps the Prophet's wives caused him trouble like women usually cause their husbands trouble, resulting from jealousy, vexation, and the like.\nIn this Had\u012bth, \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b (may Allah be pleased with him) narrates that when the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) secluded himself from his wives and swore not to enter upon them, for he was angry with them, \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) entered the Prophet's mosque \"and found the people pelting the ground with pebbles,\" i.e., moving them around and throwing them on the ground, which is something normally done by someone concerned and absorbed in thought. \"And saying: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) divorced his wives,\" i.e. when they saw how the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) kept himself away from his wives, they thought that he had divorced them, so they said this. \"And that was before they were commanded with Hij\u0101b,\" i.e., women conceal themselves from men. This remark is questionable; rather, it is a clear mistake since Hij\u0101b was enjoined at the time of the Prophet's marriage to Zaynab bint Jahsh (may Allah be pleased with her) in the fourth or fifth year, and Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her) was among his wives who were given the choice; and the story of his seclusion from his wives and giving them the choice took place in the ninth year of Hijrah. The best thing said with this regard to: \"that it was before they were commanded with Hij\u0101b\" is from the words of the narrator who, when seeing that 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said he had entered upon '\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), thought that this was before Hij\u0101b, so he affirmed it. This could be responded by saying: Entering does not entail removing Hij\u0101b (screen), for he could enter from the door, and she could still talk to him from behind the screen.\nThen, \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that he said to himself: \"I must find this out today,\" i.e., I must find out the truth about this, did the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) divorce them or not? So, \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) entered upon \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), the Prophet's wife and Abu Bakr's daughter, and said to her: \"O daughter of Abu Bakr, have you gone to the extent of giving trouble to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him)?!\" blaming her for daring to infuriate the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: \"O Ibn al-Khatt\u0101b, stay out of my affairs,\" i.e., you are not entitled to admonish me \"and mind your receptacle,\" i.e., rather, you should admonish the one who matters to you, referring to Hafsah bint \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with her). \"\u2018Aybah\" (receptacle): the container used for keeping clothes and precious belongings. A man's \"\u2018aybah\": his family and those close to him. Then, \u2018Umar entered upon his daughter Hafsah and said to her what he had said to \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with them) and added reprovingly: \"By Allah, you know that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) does not love you, and had it not been for me, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would have divorced you,\" deterring and frightening her with divorce and the fact that if it had not been for \u2018Umar's special status with the Prophet, this would have occurred. Thereupon, Hafsah cried bitterly because of her sadness about being separated from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and expecting her father to be severely mad at her. Then, \u2018Umar asked his daughter (may Allah be pleased with both of them) where the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was. Hafsah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: \"He is in his cabinet in the attic room.\" \"Mashrubah\" (attic room): is an elevated room for storing food and drink. On entering, 'Umar found Rab\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet's servant, \"sitting on the attic's doorstep,\" i.e., on the doorsill \"with his legs dangling,\" i.e., stretching and hanging them \"on carved wood\", which is a trunk that had stairs used by the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to ascend to the room and descend from that place using it as a stair. \u2018Umar, then, called out to Rab\u0101h (may Allah be pleased with both of them) to seek permission for him to enter upon the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). So, Rab\u0101h looked inside the room, then, looked at \u2018Umar and said nothing. This indirectly indicates that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had heard \u2018Umar's voice; however, he expressed no approval or disapproval of permitting him. So, \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) again sought permission from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), and Rab\u0101h again looked at the room then looked at \u2018Umar and said nothing. On the third time, \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) raised his voice so the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would hear him and he called out: \"O Rab\u0101h, seek permission for me from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). I think that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) thought I had come for Hafsah's sake,\" i.e., to apologize for what she did and defend her. \"By Allah, if the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commands me to strike her neck, I will certainly strike her neck.\" This clarified why he sought permission, namely to console the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and bring him out of his sadness and not for anything related to his daughter Hafsah (may Allah be pleased with her). Rab\u0101h, thus, signaled with his head to \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) after the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had permitted him to ascend to him in his attic.\nOn entering upon the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), \u2018Umar saw him \"lying on a straw mat,\" i.e., lying on his side on the straw mat. Another version in the two \"Sah\u012bh Collections\" reads: \"And he was on a straw mat with nothing between him and the mat,\" i.e., he was lying thereon without any bedding. \"Has\u012br\" (straw mat): a mat made of palm leaf stalks or others things. 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) sat down, so the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) drew up his lower garment over his body to cover it more. \"Iz\u0101r\" (lower garment): it is the garment used to cover the lower part of the body. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was not wearing anything except this lower garment. \"and the mat had left marks on his side,\" i.e., it left marks on his side as a result of sleeping on it. 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) looked around, exploring the room where the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was staying and found nothing but a handful - i.e., a pile - of barley equal to one S\u0101 '. S\u0101\u2018: it is four Mudds, and one Mudd is equal to an amount that could fill both hands. He found an equal amount of \"the leaves of mimosa flava placed in one side of the room,\" i.e., in one of its sides and at a distance from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). It is said that \"Qarazh\" (mimosa flava) means: a kind of tree used in tanning leather. \"And a semi-tanned leather bag hanging,\" which is leather that is not yet tanned. All this indirectly indicates the threadbareness of the place where the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was staying and the straitened circumstances he was living in.\n\u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"Tears started falling from my eyes,\" i.e., tears started flowing by way of sympathy for the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked him about the reason for his weeping, so \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) replied: \"O Prophet of Allah, how could I not weep when this straw mat has left marks on your side and I see nothing in your cabinet except what I see, while Caesar and Khosrau are enjoying fruits and rivers, whereas you are the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and His chosen one and this is your cabinet?!\" All this serves as an indirect reference to the bliss that the disbelievers enjoy compared to the conditions of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). What \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) meant is that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and the Muslims are more entitled to this bliss than the disbelievers. Khosrau: it is the title of the Persians' king. Caesar: it is the title of the Romans' king. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"O Ibn al-Khatt\u0101b, does it not please you that the Hereafter is for us and the worldly life is for them?\" In this way, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) explained to him the logic of the worldly pleasures and that of the Hereafter, as part of Allah's immutable rule regarding His slaves is to make the disbelievers enjoy the worldly pleasures. In contrast, His believing slaves will enjoy the enjoyments of the Hereafter, taking into consideration the contradiction between these two types of pleasures and the believers' eternal abidance in the bliss of Paradise and, on the contrary, the disbelievers' eternal abidance in Hellfire. \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"Yes\" it pleases me, O Messenger of Allah. There were signs of anger on the Prophet's face that \u2018Umar noticed the moment he entered, so, \u2018Umar said to him: \"O Messenger of Allah, what trouble have the women caused you?\" He was trying to alleviate the Prophet's sadness and anger. In other words, no trouble will befall you, and you should not care about any of their affairs. \"If you had divorced them, verily, Allah is with you, His angels, Jibr\u012bl (Gabriel):\" the angel entrusted with the revelation, \"Mik\u0101\u2019\u012bl (Michael):\" the angel entrusted with the rain and plants, \"I, Abu Bakr, and the believers are with you\" also with our support and assistance in Da\u2018wah (call to Allah) and the divine message. \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that he rarely spoke - thanks be to Allah for this - words except that he hoped Allah would confirm the words he uttered, i.e., he was secretly asking Allah to confirm the soundness of his advice to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) with Qur\u2019an. 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was then informed that the Verse of Choice was revealed to confirm his speech with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). It is the verse where the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) gave his wives the choice either to remain as his wives or to be divorced and released, as Allah Almighty says: {But if you insist on conspiring against him, then indeed Allah is his Protector, as well as Gabriel and the righteous believers, and moreover, the angels are his supporters. Perhaps, if he were to divorce you all, his Lord would replace you with better wives.} [Surat at-Tahr\u012bm: 4-5] It is said: There is no choice in these verses and mentioning it here is a delusion. In Al-Bukh\u0101ri's version, it was reported that \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: \"The Prophet's wives backed each other against him out of jealousy, so, I said to them: Perhaps, if he were to divorce you all, his Lord would replace you with better wives; and so this verse was revealed.\" The sound opinion here is what was proven in the two Sah\u012bh Collections and others, namely that the Verse of Choice is the verse where Allah Almighty says: {O Prophet, tell your wives, \u201cIf you seek the life of this world and its embellishments, then come, I will give you provision and release you graciously. But if you seek Allah and His Messenger and the Final Abode, then Allah has prepared for those who do good among you a great reward.\u201d} [Surat al-Ahz\u0101b: 28-29] It is said: There is a missing \"and\" probably in his saying: \"The Verse of Choice\", and the correct view is: \"This verse and the Verse of Choice were revealed\".\nHe reported that '\u0100\u2019ishah and Hafsah (may Allah be pleased with both of them) used to cooperate against the rest of the Prophet's wives, forming a team together. The cause behind their excessive jealousy was divulging his secret, which made him upset and angry. \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), then, asked the Messenger of Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) if he had divorced his wives, trying to find out the truth about what people were saying in the mosque. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) negated divorcing his wives, and 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) informed him of how the people felt sad for the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) because of what was circulated about him divorcing his wives. 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), then asked for the Prophet's permission to go down to the people, inform them of the correct news, and clarify the truth for them to rejoice. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) agreed and said to him: \"If you wish,\" i.e. if you like and want to do so.\n\u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that he kept talking to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) until there were no more signs of anger on his face and his teeth showed from laughing. \"And he had the most charming front teeth of all people.\" \"Thaghr\" (front teeth): the mouth and front teeth. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) descended from the attic where he had been staying in seclusion, and \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) descended while catching hold of the trunk and resting on it. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went down \"as if he was walking on the ground without touching it with his hand,\" i.e., he did not need to rest on the trunk when coming down due to his strength. \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"O Messenger of Allah, you remained in your room for twenty-nine,\" i.e., there is one day left to complete a month, as the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) swore not to have intercourse with his wives for a month. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"The month consists of twenty-nine,\" i.e., this month was twenty-nine days. \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) stood at the door of the mosque and called out at the top of his voice: \"The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not divorce his wives\", telling and informing the Prophet's Companions that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not divorce his wives contrary to what they had been saying, and this verse was revealed: {Whenever they hear any news of security or fear, they spread it. If they referred it to the Messenger or those in authority among them, those with sound judgment could know it.} [Surat an-Nis\u0101\u2019: 83] When the people said that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had divorced his wives based on no information from anyone and without verifying or checking this out, Allah Almighty blamed them because if they had referred this to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), he would have informed them of the truth about it, or they could have referred it to someone who could ask and find out the truth about it from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"And it was I who drew correct conclusions,\" i.e., verified this matter and checked it out.\n\"And Allah Almighty revealed the Verse of Choice,\" as previously mentioned. In the two Sah\u012bh Collections, it was mentioned that \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: He started with me as the first woman. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"I will mention something, but you should only hasten if you consult your parents. She said: Indeed, I know my parents would not order me to leave you.\" Al-Bukh\u0101ri's version reads: \"Then, he gave all of his wives the choice, and they said the same as what \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah had said.\"\nIn some narrations in the two Sah\u012bh Collections, the following was reported: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) kept himself secluded from his wives because of the honey he used to drink in the house of Zaynab bint Jahsh. '\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: \"I agreed with Hafsah that the one upon whom the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would enter should say: I can detect the smell of Magh\u0101f\u012br in you, did you eat Magh\u0101f\u012br - Magh\u0101f\u012br: sweet gum that has a foul odor. When he entered upon one of them, she said that to him, and he said: No, but I drank honey in the house of Zaynab bint Jahsh, and I will not drink it again. Thereupon, this verse was revealed: {O Prophet, why do you prohibit [yourself from] what Allah has made lawful to you} to: {You both had better turn to Allah in repentance.} [Surat at-Tahr\u012bm: 1-4] to \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah and Hafsah, {And [remember] when the Prophet told one of his wives something in secret} [Surat at-Tahr\u012bm: 3], as he said: No, but I drank honey.\" It is said: The reason is that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had sexual intercourse with his bondmaid M\u0101riyah in the house of Hafsah (may Allah be pleased with her) and Hafsah (may Allah be pleased with her) learned about it. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ordered her not to inform \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her). However, Hafsah (may Allah be pleased with her) revealed the Prophet's secret to \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her). It is also said: The reason is the things they did as a whole that enraged the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and not a specific incident.\nThe Had\u012bth shows the Prophet's good morals and how he would honor whoever smiled at him by smiling back at him.\nIt also indicates the manifest merit of \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him).\nIt points out how a man should advise his daughter and fix her manners towards her husband.\nIt also signifies that putting a lot of pressure on women is something dispraised.\nIt encourages favoring the Hereafter by performing acts of obedience, avoiding sins, and refraining from being preoccupied with the pursuit of worldly pleasures.."}, {"number": 516, "hadith": "Abu Is-h\u0101q reported:  I was with Al-Aswad ibn Yaz\u012bd sitting in the grand mosque, and Ash-Sha\u2018bi was with us, and he narrated the Had\u012bth of F\u0101timah bint Qays: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) entitled her to no housing or financial maintenance. Then, Al-Aswad took a handful of pebbles and threw it at him and said: Woe to you! How could you narrate this?! \u2018Umar said: We must not abandon the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of our Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) on account of a woman's statement. We do not know whether she memorized or forgot. She is entitled to housing and financial maintenance. Allah Almighty says: {Do not force them out of their houses, nor should they leave unless they commit a clear shameful act.} [Surat at-Tal\u0101q: 1].", "commentary": "Allah has prescribed divorce after sparing no effort in reconciliation between the spouses. He has clarified its rulings and consequences, and He has made it three incidents of divorce so that each of the spouses would reconsider his stance; otherwise, they should be separated after the third incident of divorce, and the woman becomes unlawful for him after that until she is married to another man.\nThis Had\u012bth is related to a story mentioned in the two Sah\u012bh Collections and others about the female Companion F\u0101timah bint Qays (may Allah be pleased with her) who was triply divorced by her husband. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanded her to move to the house of Ibn' Umm Makt\u016bm - who was her cousin and was blind - and spend her 'Iddah (waiting period) there. He made her not entitled to financial maintenance for her particular case, as she used to offend her husband's family verbally or because she was in a desolate area and it was feared that someone might assault her; hence, he moved her to the house of Ibn' Umm Makt\u016bm, as he was blind and would not see her. F\u0101timah bint Qays kept on narrating this Had\u012bth of hers after the Prophet's death; however, a group of the Companions disapproved of it. The T\u0101bi\u2018i Abu Is-h\u0101q as-Sab\u012b\u2018i narrates that he was with Al-Aswad ibn Yaz\u012bd an-Nakha\u2018i - one of the T\u0101bi\u2018is - in the great mosque, i.e., the grand mosque, which refers to the mosque of K\u016bfah, while Ash-Sha\u2018bi - \u2018\u0100mir ibn Shar\u0101h\u012bl one of the T\u0101bi\u2018is - was narrating the Had\u012bth of F\u0101timah bint Qays in this mosque, i.e., giving a legal fatwa based on this Had\u012bth. In this Had\u012bth, it is stated that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not make F\u0101timah entitled to housing or financial maintenance after being triply divorced. So, Al-Aswad took a handful of pebbles and threw them at him and said: \"Woe to you!\", i.e., may Allah afflict you with ruin and destruction. It was a common saying among the Arabs that was not intended as a supplication. \"How could you narrate this?!\" All this was meant to express Al-Aswad's disapproval of Ash-Sha\u2018bi's narration of this Had\u012bth. Then, he informed him that \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"We must not abandon the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of our Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) on account of a woman's statement,\" i.e., we do not rely on issuing a Fatwa (legal opinion) like this on the Had\u012bth of F\u0101timah, given the importance of such a Fatwa, because she might have memorized it in the wrong way or she might have forgotten. Perhaps what \u2018Umar meant by the Prophet's Sunnah was what his rulings indicated of adhering to the Book of Allah not a specific Sunnah in this regard. \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), then, supported his saying that the triply divorced woman is entitled to housing and financial maintenance in her \u2018Iddah by the verse in which Allah Almighty says: {O Prophet, when you [believers] divorce women, divorce them with consideration to their waiting period and keep a precise count of the waiting period, and fear Allah, your Lord. Do not force them out of their houses, nor should they leave unless they commit a clear shameful act.} [Surat at-Tal\u0101q: 1] In other words: O people, fear Allah your Lord and beware of disobeying Him by transgressing His limit; do not force your divorced wives out of their houses, where you made them live before divorce, until their \u2018Iddah is over. \"Shameful act\" here refers to recalcitrance and bad morals. It is said: It means indecency towards her husband's family. It is also said that it means: Unless they commit adultery.\nThe Had\u012bth of F\u0101timah bint Qays was refuted by a group of the Companions, including \u2018Umar, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah, and others who knew the Sunnah better than F\u0101timah bint Qays. Some considered the apparent meaning of the Had\u012bth and, thus, made the triply divorced woman entitled to spend her 'Iddah wherever she chooses without being obliged to spend the night at her ex-husband's house.\nThe Had\u012bth shows how a scholar should be corrected, even in his gatherings of knowledge, if he is mistaken.\nIt also highlights the Companions' keenness on adhering to the Qur\u2019an and the authentic Sunnah.."}, {"number": 517, "hadith": "\u2018Ubaydullah ibn \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Utbah reported:  Abu \u2018Amr ibn Hafs ibn al-Mugh\u012brah set out along with \u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib to Yemen. He sent to his wife, F\u0101timah bint Qays, one pronouncement of divorce that was still left from her divorce. He commanded Al-H\u0101rith ibn Hish\u0101m and \u2018Ayy\u0101sh ibn Abi Rab\u012b\u2018ah to give her alimony. They said to her: By Allah, there is no alimony for you unless you are pregnant. Thereupon, she went to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and informed him of what they had said. He said: There is no alimony for you. She, then, asked his permission to move, and he permitted her. She said: O Messenger of Allah, where? He said: To the house of Ibn \u2019Umm Makt\u016bm, as he was blind and she could take off her clothes in his presence and he would not see her. When her \u2018Iddah (waiting period) was over, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) gave her in marriage to Us\u0101mah ibn Zayd. Marw\u0101n sent Qab\u012bsah ibn Dhu\u2019ayb to ask her about the Had\u012bth, and she narrated it to him, whereupon Marw\u0101n said: We have not heard this Had\u012bth except from a woman. We shall adopt a safe path that we have found people upon. On hearing what Marw\u0101n said, F\u0101timah said: The Qur\u2019an is between me and you. Allah Almighty says: {Do not force them out of their houses.} [Surat at-Tal\u0101q: 1] She said: This is regarding revocable divorce. What happens after the three? Why do you say there is no alimony for her if she is not pregnant? Then, on what grounds do you restrain her?.", "commentary": "Allah has prescribed divorce and clarified its rulings and consequences after sparing no effort in reconciliation between the spouses. He has made it three incidents of divorce so that each of the spouses would reconsider their stance; otherwise, they should be separated after the third incident of divorce, and the woman becomes unlawful for him after that until she is married to another man.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i \u2018Ubaydullah ibn \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Utbah reports that the Companion Abu \u2018Amr ibn Hafs ibn al-Mugh\u012brah (may Allah be pleased with him) set out on a journey along with \u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u0101lib (may Allah be pleased with him) to Yemen when the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) sent him there. Abu \u2018Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) sent to his wife F\u0101timah bint Qays a pronouncement of divorce while traveling. He had previously divorced her twice and had taken her back, and this was the third incident that made the divorce irrevocable. Abu \u2018Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) commanded Al-H\u0101rith ibn Hish\u0101m and \u2018Ayy\u0101sh ibn Abi Rab\u012b\u2018ah (may Allah be pleased with both of them) to give her alimony. Another version narrated by Muslim reads: \"He sent his deputy to her with barley, \" but F\u0101timah declined it because she found it inadequate and did not accept it. They said to her: \"By Allah, there is no alimony for you\" because you are irrevocably divorced, and alimony is not for someone in your case \"unless you are pregnant\". In the version of An-Nas\u0101\u2019i: \"So, she sent to Al-H\u0101rith and 'Ayy\u0101sh asking them for the alimony that was appointed for her by her husband, and they said: By Allah, no alimony is due on us for her unless she is pregnant, and she is not entitled to live in our house except with our permission.\" Thereupon, F\u0101timah went to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and informed him of what they had said, namely that she was not entitled to alimony unless she was pregnant. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) approved of what they had said and said to her: \"There is no alimony for you.\" She then sought the Prophet's permission to move from her house, where she was divorced, as she was afraid for herself. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) permitted her to move to the house of her cousin Ibn' Umm Makt\u016bm as he was blind and would not see her when taking off her clothes. His permission for her to go out is justified by the fact that he permitted her to move for an excuse, namely her indecency towards her husband's relatives or her fear that she might be assaulted, as mentioned in the narrations. However,  if there is no need, then it is impermissible for her to go out or move, and it is forbidden to move her. Allah Almighty says: {Do not force them out of their houses, nor should they leave unless they commit a clear shameful act.} [Surat at-Tal\u0101q: 1] \"Shameful act\" here refers to recalcitrance and bad morals. It is said: It means indecency towards her husband's family. It is also said that it means: Unless they commit adultery.\nWhen her 'Iddah was over, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) gave her in marriage to Us\u0101mah ibn Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) for knowing that he was religious, virtuous, had good morals and noble traits.\nAt that time, Marw\u0101n ibn al-Hakam was the ruler of Mad\u012bnah. He sent Qab\u012bsah ibn Dhu\u2019ayb to F\u0101timah (may Allah be pleased with her) to ask about this Had\u012bth, and she narrated it to him. The reason why Marw\u0101n asked her was mentioned in the version of An-Nas\u0101\u2019i: \"'Abdullah ibn' Amr ibn' Uthm\u0101n, being a young man in the emirate of Marw\u0101n, divorced the daughter of Sa\u2018\u012bd ibn Zayd and her mother was Bint Qays al-Battah. So, her maternal aunt, F\u0101timah bint Qays, sent to her commanding her to move from the house of 'Abdullah ibn' Amr. When Marw\u0101n heard about that, he sent to the daughter of Sa\u2018\u012bd, commanding her to return to her house and asking her why she moved from her house before completing her 'Iddah.\" She informed him of the Had\u012bth of F\u0101timah, thereupon, Marw\u0101n was sent to F\u0101timah to verify this Had\u012bth. After hearing her Had\u012bth, Marw\u0101n said: \"We have not heard this Had\u012bth except from a woman,\" by way of disapproval, and before Marw\u0101n, \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b and \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with both of them) expressed their disapproval of F\u0101timah's Had\u012bth. Marw\u0101n said: \"We shall adopt a safe path that we found people upon,\" i.e., what is reliable, strong, and authentic and what people held fast upon and adhered to and acted upon. In other words, we shall adopt the opinion that a woman must not leave her house except after her \u2018Iddah is over and that there is no alimony for her. On hearing what Marw\u0101n said and how he prevented the irrevocably divorced woman from leaving her house under all circumstances, F\u0101timah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Qur\u2019an is between me and you, Allah Almighty says: {Do not force them out of their houses.} [Surat at-Tal\u0101q: 1] Taking this as supporting evidence, she said: This prohibition, which is understood from the first part of the verse, addresses the husband who can take back his wife, i.e., the housing is for the divorced woman whose divorce is revocable, which accords with what Allah Almighty says: {Then when they have approached the end of their waiting period, either retain them honorably or part with them honorably.} [Surat at-Tal\u0101q: 2] She said: So, what happens after the three incidents of divorce? How do you prevent her from going out, then, you say: There is no alimony for her unless she is pregnant? Then, on what grounds do you restrain her? She said this as an objection to Marw\u0101n, who made the irrevocably divorced woman entitled to housing and prevented her from going out without giving her financial maintenance. To sum up, her objection was: If you do not make the alimony obligatory, how could you prevent her from going out if the alimony is the recompense of being restrained?!."}, {"number": 518, "hadith": "\u2018\u0100\u2019ishah reported:  It is no good for F\u0101timah to mention this.

He has made it three incidents of divorce so that each of the two spouses would reconsider their stance. Otherwise, they would be separated after the third incident of divorce, and she becomes unlawful for him after this until she gets married to another man. Islam has also regulated the rights and duties between spouses after divorce.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Muhammad ibn al-Q\u0101sim narrates that when the Mother of the Believers \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was informed of what F\u0101timah bint Qays had said, namely that her husband had divorced her thrice and the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not make her entitled to housing or financial maintenance during her \u2018Iddah (waiting period), she said disapprovingly: \"It is no good for F\u0101timah\" bint Qays \"to mention\" and narrate \"this\" Had\u012bth to people because it contradicts the explicit texts of the Book of Allah Almighty and the Sunnah of His Messenger (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\nA group of the Companions, including \u2018Umar, \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah and others, rejected the Had\u012bth of F\u0101timah bint Qays because it contradicts, in their opinion, the verse in which Allah Almighty says: {O Prophet, when you [believers] divorce women, divorce them with concern to their waiting period and keep an accurate count of the waiting period, and fear Allah, your Lord. Do not force them out of their houses, nor should they leave unless they commit a clear shameful act. Such are the limits ordained by Allah.} [Surat at-Tal\u0101q: 1] It is said: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanded her to leave her house and spend her 'Iddah in the house of Ibn' Umm Makt\u016bm and did not make her entitled to financial maintenance only because of her special case, as she used to verbally offend her husband's family, or because she was in a desolate place and it was feared that her husband or anyone else might assault her.

He has made it three divorces; so that each of the two spouses would reconsider their stance. Otherwise, they would be separated after the third divorce, and she becomes unlawful for him after this until she gets married to another man. Islam has also regulated the rights and duties between spouses after divorce. Allah Almighty has commanded the divorced woman - whether the divorce is revocable or irrevocable - to spend the \u2018Iddah (waiting period) in her house. Allah Almighty says: {O Prophet, when you [believers] divorce women, divorce them with concern to their waiting period and keep an accurate count of the waiting period, and fear Allah, your Lord. Do not force them out of their houses, nor should they leave unless they commit a clear shameful act.

This means: She was afraid that someone would enter upon her and harm her because she was in a desolate place. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanded her to leave that place and she went to the house of her paternal cousin, Ibn \u2019Umm Makt\u016bm, because he was blind, and she could take off her clothes without him seeing her. Since she did not spend her \u2018Iddah in her husband's house, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not make her entitled to habitation or financial sustenance during her \u2018Iddah.."}, {"number": 520, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdullah reported:  My maternal aunt was divorced, and she wanted to harvest her date palm trees. A man rebuked her for going out, so she went to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) who said: \"Yes, go out and harvest your date palm trees, for you may give (some of it) in charity or do a good deed.\".", "commentary": "The Islamic Shariah has brought facilitation and goodness to people. It takes into consideration their conditions when carrying out the Shariah rulings to prevent them from falling into difficulty or distress.\nIn this Had\u012bth, J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) narrates that his maternal aunt - it was said: her name is Asm\u0101\u2019 - was irrevocably divorced, as mentioned in the version of Abu D\u0101w\u016bd: \"My maternal aunt was divorced thrice.\" She wanted to go out, during her \u2018Iddah (waiting period), to collect the fruits from her date palm trees; however, a man rebuked her and forbade her from going out until her \u2018Iddah was over. She went to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to ask him. She informed him of what had happened and of her condition and her need for harvesting her date palm trees and asked him if it was permissible for her to go out of her house during her \u2018Iddah due to this necessity. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessing be upon him) replied saying: \"Yes,\" and the version of Abu D\u0101w\u016bd reads: \"Go out,\" and collect your fruits, for perhaps after collecting the fruit of your date palm trees you may give part of it in charity to the poor and the needy \"or do a good deed.\" \"Ma\u2018r\u016bf\" (good deed): a comprehensive name including every known act of obeying Allah and doing good to people. This is an explanation of permitting the act of going out, even though it came in the form of  notifying and urging her to do good. Moreover, he permitted her to go out due to her need to look after her interests, her date palm trees, and her properties as understood from the apparent indication of the beginning of the Had\u012bth.\nPerhaps the difference between charity and a good deed is that the former refers to obligatory charity, while the latter refers to voluntary charity. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said this to her only because he knew that she was a charitable person, who used to do good deeds frequently, or he answered her with what would guide her to charity and voluntary charity, and this denotes obvious kindness and wisdom.\nThe Had\u012bth implies guiding the questioner to what is good for him in his religion and worldly matters and adding to the response what the questioner needs.\nIt also indicates the permissibility of going out for the divorced woman during her \u2018Iddah for a necessity and for fulfilling her interests that she cannot dispense with.\nIt denotes the permissibility of being keen on preserving wealth and acquiring it to do good and use it in consoling others.\nIt also indicates that charity in dates is to be given at the time of their harvest, and gifting others therefrom.\nIt also includes giving an indirect reference to the dates' owner to give charity and reminding him of good deeds and beneficence.."}, {"number": 521, "hadith": "Sa\u2018\u012bd ibn Jubayr reported:  I was asked about the two who swore the oath of condemnation during the governance of Mus\u2018ab; should they be separated? I did not know what to say, so I went to Ibn \u2018Umar's house in Makkah. I said to the servant: Seek permission for me. He said: He is taking a nap; but he heard my voice and said: Is this Ibn Jubayr? I said: Yes. He said: Come in. By Allah, you have not come at this time except for a need. I entered and found him lying on a saddlecloth and resting his head on a fibre-filled pillow. I said: O Abu \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n, should the two involved in a case of Li\u2018\u0101n (oath of condemnation) be separated? He said: Glory be to Allah! Yes. The first one who asked about this was so-and-so, the son of so-and-so. He said: O Messenger of Allah, what if any of us found his wife committing adultery? What should he do? If he were to say anything, his statement would be a horrible matter, and if he were to remain silent, his silence about the matter would also be terrible. He said: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) kept silent and did not answer him. Later on, he came to him and said: I have been afflicted with what I asked you about. Thereupon, Allah Almighty revealed these verses of Surat an-N\u016br: {As for those who accuse their wives [of adultery]} [Surat an-N\u016br: 6] So, he recited them to him, admonished and reminded him, and informed him that the worldly punishment is less severe than the punishment of the Hereafter. He said: No, by the One Who sent you with the truth I did not lie about her. Then, he called her, admonished and reminded her and informed her that the worldly punishment is less severe than the punishment of the Hereafter. She said: No, by the One Who sent you with the truth, he is a liar. So, he started with the man who testified four times by Allah that he was truthful and the fifth time that the curse of Allah would be upon him if he were a liar. Then, the woman came next, and she testified four times by Allah that he was a liar and the fifth time that Allah's wrath would be upon her if he were truthful. Then, he separated the two of them..", "commentary": "The noble Shariah has clarified the rulings of marriage between the man and the woman and has explained the rulings of the husband's accusation of his wife for committing adultery without evidence and the consequent practice of Li\u2018\u0101n, besides other rulings of separation, to protect lineages, repel shame from the spouses, and ward off the legally prescribed punishment of Qadhf (false accusation of adultery).\nIn this Had\u012bth, the great T\u0101bi\u2018i Sa\u2018\u012bd ibn Jubayr tells us that he was asked about the ruling of the two involved in Li\u2018\u0101n - when a husband accuses his wife of adultery and denies the attribution of her child to himself and the woman negates this, they are required to practice Li\u2018\u0101n (oath of condemnation) - should they be separated? He did not know what to say and was not aware of the ruling in this regard, and this was during the governance of Mus\u2018ab ibn az-Zubayr, who was the ruler of Iraq. Mus\u2018ab did not separate the spouses who practiced Li\u2018\u0101n, as clarified in another version of Muslim.\nSa\u2018\u012bd said: \"So, I went to the house of Ibn \u2018Umar in Makkah\" showing that it was a different house than that in Mad\u012bnah. It seems that it was the house of Ibn \u2018Umar where he stayed when going to Makkah for Hajj or \u2018Umrah, and it seems also that Sa\u2018\u012bd traveled from K\u016bfah to Makkah. On reaching the house of Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father), he asked the boy, Ibn \u2018Umar's servant, to seek permission for him to enter. The servant informed him that Ibn \u2018Umar was taking a nap, it was noontime and midday. Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) heard the voice of Ibn Jubayr and recognized him and asked: Is this Ibn Jubayr who is asking for permission? Ibn Jubayr replied: Yes, I am Sa\u2018\u012bd ibn Jubayr. So, he permitted him to enter and said: \"By Allah, you have not come at this time except for a need.\" This signifies the understanding and modesty of Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) and how he did not make things difficult for whoever needed him during his rest, knowing that the one who would come to him during his rest had only come for a necessity; hence, he should not be upset with him; rather, he should receive him with a cheerful face. Ibn Jubayr entered upon Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) and found him lying on a \"saddlecloth,\" a cloth laid on an animal's back under the saddle, and he was resting his head on a pillow, which is a cushion, and it was filled with fiber, i.e., tree or palm cortex.\nThen, Sa\u2018\u012bd ibn Jubayr said: \"O Abu \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n,\" which is the nickname of \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Umar, and he asked him: Should the two involved in a case of Li\u2018\u0101n be separated? Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) said: \"Glory be to Allah! Yes.\" Ibn \u2018Umar glorified Allah to express his surprise that Sa\u2018\u012bd ibn Jubayr was unaware of this famous ruling. Ibn \u2018Umar then said: \"The first one who asked about this,\" i.e., the first one who asked the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) about what you asked me about \"was so-and-so the son of so-and-so,\" who was \u2018Uwaymir al-\u2018Ajl\u0101ni as mentioned in another version in Sah\u012bh Muslim Collection: \"The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) separated between the two members of Banu al-\u2018Ajl\u0101n.\" He asked: O Messenger of Allah, tell me about the ruling of one who found his wife committing adultery; what should he do in such a situation? If he spoke about what he had seen, \"his statement would be a horrible matter\" that people would find disgusting. It would be Qadhf (false accusation of adultery) that entails flogging as a legally prescribed punishment in case he brought no evidence. \"And if he were to remain silent\" and did not speak about what he had seen, his silence about the matter would also be horrible and an unbearable feeling of anger. Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) remained silent and did not answer the man's question, waiting for the revelation and considering this a serious issue. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would hate questions about things that did not occur. This man who asked the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came back after some time and said: O Messenger of Allah, \"I have been afflicted by\" the matter I had asked you about, i.e., I have been afflicted and tested in this regard, as I saw my wife committing adultery. Thereupon, Allah Almighty revealed verses of Surat an-N\u016br: {As for those who accuse their wives [of adultery] but have no witnesses except themselves, then the evidence of one of them is to testify four times by Allah that he is telling the truth, and the fifth [oath] is that may Allah curse him if he is telling a lie. But she will be spared the punishment if she testifies four times by Allah that he is telling a lie, and the fifth [oath] is that may Allah\u2019s wrath be upon her if he is telling the truth.} [Surat an-N\u016br: 6-9] This means: That Men who accuse their wives without having witnesses besides their own selves to testify to the truthfulness of their accusation, each of them should testify four times by Allah: that he is telling the truth about accusing his wife of adultery, then, in the fifth testimony, he should add the supplication against himself of being worthy of curse if he was lying about his accusation, which makes her subject to the legal prescribed punishment of adultery. What spares her this punishment is to testify four times by Allah that he is lying about accusing her, then, in her fifth testimony, she should add the supplication against herself of being liable to Allah's wrath if he was telling the truth about what he accuses her of.\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) recited these verses to the man and admonished him in the hope that he might take back his accusation \"and reminded him\" to repent, telling him that the worldly punishment - which is the legally prescribed punishment of Qadhf - is less severe and much easier than the punishment of the Hereafter. However, the man said: \"No\" I shall not take back what I said because it is true, and he swore, saying: By the One Who sent you with the truth, I did not lie about her by accusing her of adultery and immorality. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) called the woman and admonished her to repent in case she had sinned. He reminded and informed her that the worldly punishment - which is the prescribed punishment of adultery, i.e., being stoned - is less severe and much easier than the punishment of the Hereafter. However, the woman swore that her husband was lying in his claim against her. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanded both of them to swear the oath of condemnation. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) started with the man since Allah Almighty started with him in the verse. The man swore four times by Allah that he was telling the truth about what he accused her of, and in the fifth testimony, he invoked the curse upon himself if he was a liar. Then, it was the woman's turn. So, she swore four times by Allah that her husband was lying about his claim against her by accusing her of adultery and immorality, and in the fifth, she supplicated against herself invoking Allah's wrath upon her if her husband was truthful in what he said. So, none of them admitted the truthfulness of the other. Hence, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) separated between them. One of the rulings of Li\u2018\u0101n is that if each of the spouses insists on what he said, then, they should not be united after Li\u2018\u0101n and their marriage is invalidated.\nThe Had\u012bth clarifies the ruling of Li\u2018\u0101n and its manner.\nIt points out how the sinner should be admonished and reminded of repentance.."}, {"number": 522, "hadith": "\u2018Abdullah reported:  It was Friday night, and we were in the mosque when a man from the Ans\u0101r (supporters) came and said: If a man found another man with his wife and he speaks about it, you will flog him; or if he kills, you will kill him; and if he remains silent, he will remain silent in anger. By Allah, I will surely ask the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) about it. On the next day, he came to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and asked him saying: If a man found another man with his wife and he speaks about it, you will flog him; or if he kills, you will kill him; or if he remains silent, he will remain silent in anger. He said: O Allah, judge; and he kept supplicating, so the verse of Li\u2018\u0101n (oath of condemnation) was revealed: {As for those who accuse their wives [of adultery] but have no witnesses except themselves} [Surat an-N\u016br: 6], these verses. This man, of all people, was afflicted with this. So, he came with his wife to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and swore the oath of condemnation.

These are the verses in which Allah Almighty says: {As for those who accuse their wives [of adultery] but have no witnesses except themselves, then the evidence of one of them is to testify four times by Allah that he is telling the truth, and the fifth [oath] is that may Allah curse him if he is telling a lie.

Then, in the fifth testimony, he should add the supplication against himself of being worthy of condemnation if he is lying about his accusation, which makes her subject to the legally prescribed punishment of adultery. What spares her of this punishment is to testify four times by Allah that he is lying about accusing her. Then, in her fifth testimony, she should add the supplication against herself of being liable for Allah's wrath if he is telling the truth about what he accuses her of.\nAmong all people, this man was afflicted by the occurrence of what he asked about to his wife. So, he accompanied his wife to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). They both swore the oath of condemnation, i.e., the man testified four times by Allah that he was telling the truth, and then, the fifth time, he invoked the curse of Allah upon himself if he was lying. This is because testimony in an adultery case is not complete except with four witnesses, but this case was witnessed by none except the husband; hence, he was assigned four testimonies so that each oath would replace a witness, as an oath could sometimes replace a witness like when someone is entitled to some right but has one witness only. In this case, the Shariah considers his oath in place of the witness. After completing the four testimonies that replace the four witnesses, nothing is left after the testimony of the four witnesses in adultery against the married person, as in this case, except stoning, which is death. There is nothing left after taking the oath of condemnation four times except the curse of Allah Almighty or His wrath, which also indicates death (ruin). The woman, then, went to swear the oath of condemnation, but the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to her: \"Stop,\" a word meant here to deter her, i.e., refrain and take your time. However, she refused to stop or be dissuaded from completing Li\u2018\u0101n. Hence, she took her part in Li\u2018\u0101n. When the two parties swore the oath of condemnation and went away after finishing their testimonies, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Perhaps she will give birth to\" the baby in her womb, and he will be \"a curly-haired black child,\" i.e., not straight-haired, which was the description of the one she was accused of committing adultery with. It is as if the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) most likely believed that she was lying, and the child she gave birth to was just as the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had described.\nThe Had\u012bth clarifies that the ruling of Li\u2018\u0101n, in principle, is to take place between the man and his wife if he accuses her of adultery and has no witness but himself.\nIt also points out that things must be judged according to what is apparent, whereas Allah Almighty is the One Who judges the intentions.\nIt explains how Li\u2018an must take place in the presence of the Imam or the judge and in the presence of an assembly of people.\nIt shows the condition that makes Li\u2018\u0101n obligatory, which is the woman's denial of committing adultery because if she admits it, Li\u2018\u0101n becomes impermissible and she becomes subject to the legally prescribed punishment.\nIt also signifies that it is Sunnah for the ruler to admonish the two persons involved in Li\u2018\u0101n when intending to swear the oath of condemnation, which becomes confirmed after the fifth time.."}, {"number": 523, "hadith": "Muhammad ibn S\u012br\u012bn reported: I asked Anas ibn M\u0101lik, knowing that he had knowledge of that, and he said:  Hil\u0101l ibn \u2019Umayyah accused his wife of committing adultery with Shar\u012bk ibn Sahm\u0101\u2019, the brother of Al-Bar\u0101\u2019 ibn M\u0101lik from his mother's side.

Li\u2018\u0101n: It is when a man takes an oath four times that he is truthful about accusing his wife of adultery, and on the fifth time he swears that may Allah curse him if he is lying. Then, the woman proceeds and takes an oath four times that her husband is lying, and on the fifth time she swears that may Allah's wrath be upon her if he is telling the truth. Li\u2018\u0101n took place between both of them and after they were gone, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Watch her,\" i.e., look at the baby's features so we may know which of them is lying, as she got pregnant during that period.

The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"No,\" i.e., he should not be killed; rather, witnesses should be brought, and the legally prescribed punishment should be inflicted on him; otherwise, the one who is drunk, angry, or jealous would dare to kill then claim that his wife was committing adultery and chaos would, thus, prevail. Sa\u2018d said: \"Yes\" and he swore to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) by the God Who honored and privileged him by sending him with the truth and the Shariah that whoever sees this happening to his wife will be overcome by anger and jealousy and will, thus, strike him with the sword. This was not meant as an objection to the Prophet's words; rather, it was said out of jealousy and seeking the concession to kill the adulterer when caught red-handed. Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said in wonder: \"Listen to what your master is saying!\" Master: the chief and leader, as Sa\u2018d was the master of the Khazraj from the Ans\u0101r. This means: Look at his jealousy! The end of Muslim's version reads: \"Indeed, he is jealous, and I am more jealous than he is, and Allah is more jealous than I am,\" i.e., the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) lauded Sa\u2018d's feeling of jealousy and clarified that it is from the attributes of the honorable and the eminent. The explanation of the jealousy of Allah Almighty was mentioned in the two Sah\u012bh Collections: \"The jealousy of Allah is when the believer commits what Allah has prohibited.\"\nDespite the great significance of this matter - a man seeing his wife with a strange man - and its gravity, a Muslim is required to abide by the commands of Allah Almighty and His prohibitions, even if they contradict his opinion and personal desires. Had this matter been left to the likes of what Sa\u2018d had said, the consequent evil would have been much graver and it would have paved the way for false accusations and other evil consequences.\nThe Had\u012bth shows that jealousy and chivalry must not prevent one from carrying out Allah's commands and executing His prescribed punishments.\nIt points out the necessity of having witnesses in adultery cases.."}, {"number": 525, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him)  said about the slave whose ownership is shared between two men and one of them emancipates him, he said: He should guarantee..", "commentary": "The Shariah has protected all rights including the partners' rights. It has forbidden any kind of offense practiced by one partner against the other. This Had\u012bth clarifies that when two people own a slave jointly and one of them emancipates his share of that slave, this entails emancipating the rest of the slave. When the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"He should guarantee,\" it meant that the emancipator should guarantee his partner's share of the slave whom he emancipated, i.e., he is financially responsible for securing the complete freedom of that slave. In the Two Sah\u012bh Collections: \"But if he has no money, the slave will be required to work to pay for his freedom, but must not be overburdened.\" So, it made it clear that if the emancipator is poor and has no money to free the rest of the slave, he remains in slavery and is required to work for his freedom and to pay for the share of the partner who did not emancipate him.

In other words, the son seeks to reach him by buying him, and it is well known that he only buys him to free him from slavery, not to have him as his own slave or to be the master of his father. So, nothing fulfills the father's right over his son, no matter what the son does, except this act. This is because Islam came when slavery and serfdom were widespread and a common habit of the Arabs, and there were bondmaids and slaves in every house.\nIt was said: If a man took possession of his father, the latter would be free by mere possession and [there is] no need to say: I set him free.

Hence, it forbade what involved fraud and ambiguity to stop disagreement and dispute among people, which is one of the Shariah-approved objectives.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade the Has\u0101h sale, which was one of the sales practiced by the people of J\u0101hiliyyah. If the seller or the buyer threw a pebble, that would be a sign of finalizing the sale. It had three forms: First: The seller says to the buyer: I would sell you of these garments that on which the pebble I throw falls; or: I would sell you a piece of this land from here to the part that this pebble reaches. Second: Considering the act of throwing the pebble itself a sale by saying: If you throw the pebble at this garment, it will be sold to you at such-and-such. Third: Saying: You have the option to either accept or reject the sale until I throw this pebble. It was said: It means saying: Throw the pebble and whatever number comes out, I will be entitled to an equal number of dinars or dirhams. All these are forms of invalid sales that entail doing injustice to one of the two parties of the sale.\nThe Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) also forbade the Gharar sale. Gharar means danger, delusion, and deceit. This is a generalization after a specification, as it includes any sale that involves any kind of deceit, or that which is ambiguous or cannot be fulfilled. One of the rationales behind forbidding this sale is the fact that it is a waste of money, for one may not be able to get the sold item, which means that he spent his money in vain.\nThe Had\u012bth prohibits deception and fraud in sales.\nIt warns against consuming people's properties wrongfully.\nIt also points out that the object of a sale transaction must be something known and must have a known price.."}, {"number": 528, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  Do not go out to meet what is being brought for trade.

They must not receive them before arriving and being acquainted with the prices of commodities in such a country because this might harm the seller as they might buy from him at a lower price than its known price, which would result in harming the owner of the commodity by underestimating its price. Hence, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanded the one who goes out to meet it and buys something thereof, and does not comply with the prohibition. So when \"its master,\" i.e., the owner of the commodity, comes to the market, he will have the option either to effect the sale or take back his goods, for perhaps he did him injustice and wronged him regarding its price compared to its price in this country.\nThe Had\u012bth encourages truthfulness and transparency and the avoidance of deceit in commercial transactions.\nIt shows the Prophet's keenness on whatever brings goodness to his Ummah and his kindness towards them even when it comes to worldly interests.."}, {"number": 529, "hadith": "Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  Whoever buys food should not sell it until he measures it.

This is an indirect reference that the buyer should receive it and it becomes in his possession and knows its amount in a way that negates ambiguity. This is related to what is sold by measure as in this case, so it must be first measured until he receives it in full, then, he may sell it afterward. It is not lawful for him to sell it before measuring it, as it could be subject to excess or deficiency, which entails doing injustice and harm either to the seller or the buyer. Thereupon, T\u0101w\u016bs ibn Kays\u0101n - from the T\u0101bi\u2018is - asked Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him and his father): \"Why?\" i.e., why did the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) stipulate this condition? Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) said: \"Do you not see them transacting with gold, whereas the food is deferred?\" In other words, the seller used to take the price in gold dinars, and then he would delay the delivery of food to the buyer. Therefore, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) stipulated that the buyer should not resell it until he receives it and it becomes in his possession. Another Had\u012bth in the two Sah\u012bh Collections clarified that what he meant by that is to transfer the food to another place or to the markets where it is sold in order not to be monopolized or manipulate its price. So, he made it clear that the right thing is to transfer it to the markets, which are known to people, where food is sold and to take possession of it, since Qabd (taking possession) is a condition, and transferring it as mentioned fulfills this condition.\nMoreover, in the two Sah\u012bh Collections, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade reselling the food after buying it until he receives it in full, i.e., he should not adopt any procedure or dispose of it by selling it again unless he first takes what he has purchased and it becomes in his full possession. Only then, he can resell it. This guarantees preventing any harm to the seller, the buyer, or the dwellers of this country that could result in disputes and conflicts between people and, thus, inflict harm upon them.\nThe Had\u012bth shows the Prophet's keenness on whatever brings goodness to his Ummah and his kindness towards them even when it comes to worldly interests.\nIt highlights the prohibition of adopting sale methods that lead to the monopoly of goods and the rise in prices, or that cause harm to the parties involved in the sale transaction.."}, {"number": 530, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade selling a heap of dried dates, whose measure is unknown, for a specified amount of dried dates..", "commentary": "The rulings of sale transactions in Islam revolve around honesty and the absence of uncertainty among the parties involved in the sale.

In Muslim's version, he did not mention his saying: \"of dried dates\" at the end of the Had\u012bth, which indicates the inclusion of all types of food sold without knowing its amount in exchange for a known amount of its like. \"For a specified amount of dried dates,\" i.e., he forbade selling an unknown amount for a known amount of the same type, like dried dates for dried dates, wheat for wheat, and barley for barley, as this involves ambiguity regarding the unmeasured food from one aspect besides involving Riba al-Fadl (usury of surplus) from another aspect, bearing in mind that ignorance about the equality between the sold and purchased items is like knowing that there is a surplus between them, which is clear Riba. If the items subject to Riba rulings are the same, then, they must be the same in measure and hand to hand. However, if they are of different types, then, there is nothing wrong with the surplus between them like in the case of selling dried dates for wheat, or barley for corn, and the same applies to selling for cash, gold, or silver.\nThe Had\u012bth clarifies how the Shariah regulates the process of selling and buying to avoid the occurrence of disputes.."}, {"number": 531, "hadith": "J\u0101bir reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade leasing land and selling it ahead for years, and selling fruits before ripening..", "commentary": "In the pre-Islamic era of ignorance, there prevailed types of sale that brimmed with oppression and injustice.

What is meant by selling it here is its \"Kir\u0101\u2019\" (leasing), which means taking a share of the fruits as a rent for the land. It was called \"sale\" because it refers to selling a benefit. His saying: \"Two or three years\" indicates that the land may not yield a product during one of the contract years. Hence, its cultivator will need to fulfill his contract. For this reason, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) made the original state of the land dominant in the contract so that none of them would deceive the other or consume his brother's property wrongfully.\nAs for leasing in return for gold, silver, or cash, there is nothing wrong with that, for in the two Sah\u012bh Collections - the wording is that of Muslim - Hanzhalah ibn Qays reported: \"That he asked R\u0101fi\u2018 ibn Khad\u012bj about leasing land, and he said: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade leasing land. He said: I said: Even in return for gold and silver? He said: If it is in return for gold and silver, there is no harm with that.\"\nThe Prohibition in this Had\u012bth is from uncertainty in leasing land in return for something ambiguous or not guaranteed of its fruits and how the transaction should be transparent and known to avoid discord and wasting people's properties.."}, {"number": 535, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah reported:  the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) gave a concession for the sale of \u2018Ar\u0101y\u0101 (unpicked ripe dates for dry dates) by estimation when they are less than - or he said: equal to - five Wasqs (a standard measure)..", "commentary": "In the pre-Islamic era of ignorance, there were types of Riba-based sales. When Islam came, it rectified and refined such sale transactions and established the fair sale, which is free from Riba (usury). It forbade all types of sales that involve a possibility of Riba and that involve injustice.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reports that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) \"gave a concession,\" i.e., allowed and permitted, \"the sale of \u2018Ar\u0101y\u0101\": A type of sale that takes the following form: Buying fresh dates after becoming ripe on the date palms for dry dates. So, the fruits on the date palm are given to the needy to eat therefrom whenever they like. What is on the date palms is estimated and dry dates are taken in exchange. It was called the \u2018Ar\u0101ya sale because the owner of the date palm gives it to a needy person, i.e., he strips it of its fruits for his sake. However, the Shariah set a condition that this should be done \"by estimation,\" i.e., with a similar number of dried dates for the unpicked fruits. This is because some people would witness the season of ripe dates and wish to feed their children therefrom while having no date palms or money. Hence, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) wanted to show kindness to them. He also stipulated that this should be of a measure or weight less than \"five Wasqs\", and the \"Wasq\" is a standard measure that is equal to sixty S\u0101\u2018s, i.e. (130.5kg) one hundred thirty kilograms and a half. Therefore, five Wasqs are equal to almost (653kg) six hundred fifty-three kilograms.\nThis means: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) granted them a concession regarding this kind of sale with this amount only because it could be mistakenly thought to be Riba, as the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade selling fruits for fruits of the same type, which is called a Muz\u0101banah sale (selling something definite for an indefinite amount of its kind). It is as if the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) made for them the exception of the \u2018Ar\u0101ya sale from Muz\u0101banah and restricted it to five Wasqs to avoid the possibility of Riba.\nHis saying: \"Or equal to five Wasqs\" refers to the doubt that one of the Had\u012bth narrators had, and he was D\u0101w\u016bd ibn al-Husayn, as he did not remember whether it was five Wasqs or less than five Wasqs.\nThe Had\u012bth clarifies the concession granted regarding one of the sale transactions out of alleviation and facilitation for the Ummah.\nIt also points out that the specified amount in the \u2018Ar\u0101ya sale transactions is five Wasqs.."}, {"number": 536, "hadith": "Ibn \u2018Umar reported:  We did not see anything wrong with Khibr until last year when R\u0101fi\u2018 claimed that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade it.

This is a question about leasing land in return for gold and silver instead of leasing it in return for part of the yield. R\u0101fi\u2018 (may Allah be pleased with him) replied that there is no objection to leasing land in return for gold and silver, and he said: \"At the time of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) the people used to lease lands in return for the yield of what grows on the banks of large rivers,\" which are the watercourses coming from the wide river.

If the rent, however, is something known and guaranteed, i.e., a known rent in cash, then there is no objection to leasing the land in return for such rent.\nThe Had\u012bth points out the permissibility of leasing land in return for a known amount of cash money.."}, {"number": 538, "hadith": "R\u0101fi\u2018 ibn Khad\u012bj reported:  At the time of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), we used to lease land based on Muh\u0101qalah so that we would lease it in return for one-third or one-quarter of the yield or a specified amount of food.

There are different opinions regarding the meaning of Muh\u0101qalah. It is said: It means leasing the land in return for wheat, as interpreted in some versions, which is called Muh\u0101rathah by the cultivators. It is said: It means the cultivation of land in return for a known share of its produce, like one-third, one-fourth, or the like as mentioned in this Had\u012bth. It is said: It means selling food in its ears in return for wheat grains. It is said: It means selling crops before fully growing. His saying: \"And for a specified amount of food,\" i.e., by taking a specified share of the fruits as a rent for the land, and all this entails ambiguity in the contract between the owner and the lessee. Then, R\u0101fi '(may Allah be pleased with him) reported that things continued in this way until one day, one of his paternal uncles - it is said: His uncle Zhah\u012br ibn R\u0101fi '- came and informed them that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade them from something beneficial for them, referring to Muh\u0101qalah, which was what they obtained in return for using the land so that they would benefit and the worker would benefit as well. However, this benefit, in fact, is a partial benefit, and perhaps it will not be safe from harm, as its fruits might be ruined, which would lead to the loss of the right of one of them. \"But obedience to Allah and His Messenger is more beneficial for us,\" i.e., obeying Allah and His Messenger (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to what he guides us is more beneficial for us than this assumed benefit of Kir\u0101\u2019 and Muz\u0101ra\u2018ah that we used to practice. In fact, responding to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) is better and more beneficial for their religion and worldly life. One of their ways of practicing Muh\u0101qalah was leasing land in return for one-third or one-fourth of its yield or a specified amount of food, i.e., by taking a share of the fruits as a rent for the land.

The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) disliked \"leasing it or anything else,\" i.e., anything related to leasing. It is said: This was during the early days of emigration out of compassion for them; they had either to cultivate it or to let it be cultivated by others from their emigrant brothers. Then, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) granted a concession for leasing.

This clearly shows that the land was no longer owned by the Jews after being conquered by Muslims; rather, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) distributed it among the victorious Muslims and it became among their possessions. What is meant by it being a possession of Allah and His Messenger is that some of its shares were given to the Muslims' public treasury.\nOn knowing that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) wanted to deport them from Khaybar, the Jews asked him to allow them to stay in it and leave them on condition that they would work therein in the trees and the land in return for half of its fruits, whereas the other half would be for him, and he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) agreed to the condition they stipulated for themselves. His saying: \"For as long as we wish\", was an exception made by the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to the condition of their stay. It means that if Muslims wanted to expel you from that place, you would have to leave, as the Jews were not entitled to anything if Muslims had a different opinion. The agreement was concluded on such terms, and the Jews remained in Khaybar and stayed therein during the time of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and during the caliphate of Abu Bakr as-Sidd\u012bq (may Allah be pleased with him) until 'Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b (may Allah be pleased with him) became the caliph.

He said: Till there is no danger of blight,\" and it turns out as desired as when it appears to be ripe, for only then, it is safe from disease, which is the blight.."}, {"number": 543, "hadith": "J\u0101bir reported:  The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanded that calamities should be remitted..", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) established the pillars of society upon mercy and solidarity, knowing that if financial transactions are not based on justice, they will lead to the spread of oppression and the transgressing of rights among people.\nIn this Had\u012bth, J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reports that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanded that Jaw\u0101\u2019ih (calamities), plural of 'j\u0101\u2019ihah', which is the blight that affects fruits and leads to their eradication, should be remitted. This refers to every prevalent spoiler like rain, snow, locusts, wind, or fire. This means: If fruits are sold after seeming to be in good condition and were then hit by some calamity, the loss is to be suffered by the owner, not the buyer. In a version by Muslim: \"If you sell your brother some fruit and it is stricken by a calamity, it is unlawful for you to take anything from him. How can you take your brother's money unjustly?!\" This means: None of you should take his brother's money wrongfully because something predominant has overwhelmed the fruits without any negligence on the buyer's part. Therefore, the seller should not require him to pay for what Allah has damaged before he took possession of it in the usual manner, and because when the fruits are spoilt, there is nothing left for the buyer in return for what he has paid.."}, {"number": 544, "hadith": "Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Khudri reported:  At the time of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) a man suffered a loss in fruits he had purchased, and his debts increased.

Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to his creditors: \"Take what you find, and that is all you may have.\".", "commentary": "The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) established the pillars of society upon mercy and solidarity. He used to urge creditors to reduce the debt for the debtor who was afflicted by some calamity that ruined his property, be it fruits, cash, assets, or anything else. Therefore, it became part of the Muslim's attitude to constantly seek to fulfill his Muslim brother's need, especially in times of calamities and misfortunes.\nIn this Had\u012bth, Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) reports that at the time of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), a man's fruits, which he purchased but had not paid for yet, suffered blight that caused them damage, thereby his debts increased. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanded people to give him charity so he can repay his debt. In obedience to the Prophet's command, the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) gave the man charity; however, what he took from people was not enough to settle his debt because it was huge, and there still remained an unsettled part thereof. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), thus, ordered the creditors - those to whom the debt was owed - to take what they found with him from the remaining fruits that could still be useful in addition to what he got from charity. His saying: \"and that is all you may have,\" i.e., you should not ask for what is left of the debt and what he is not able to repay. It was said: That is all you may have because he is currently bankrupt and should be given respite until it is easy for him to pay it back, as Allah Almighty says: {If the debtor is in hardship, give him respite until it is easy for him to pay [the debt] back.} [Surat al-Baqarah: 280]\nThe Had\u012bth denotes that whatever the bankrupt still has, should be taken according to its assessed price.

The debtor hid from Abu Qat\u0101dah when he was searching for him, and when Abu Qat\u0101dah (may Allah be pleased with him) found him, the debtor said to him: \"I am insolvent,\" and I have no money to repay your debt.

But if you waive it as charity, that is better for you.} [Surat al-Baqarah: 280]\nThe Had\u012bth encourages the act of giving the insolvent person respite or canceling his debt.."}, {"number": 546, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade the selling of a camel's copulation, selling water and land for cultivation. This is what the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade..", "commentary": "There are some natural resources that man cannot dispense with and that are beneficial for all people. If such resources are unavailable, man will perish. Hence, they have been made common among Muslims. Moreover, one may possess what others cannot dispense with, and he may possess something without exerting effort, something that Allah has bestowed upon him, and it could exceed his need, and giving out this surplus is a manifestation of noble morals.\nIn this Had\u012bth, J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reports that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade the selling of a camel's copulation. In a version by Al-Bukh\u0101ri, Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported: \"The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade the stud fees of a stallion,\" which is the fee taken for the copulation of a male animal, whether a horse, camel, ram, etc. Its form: When someone gives his stud to someone else who owns females and keeps it with him until the stud mates with the females for a fee in return, or when the owner of the females brings them to the owner of the stud and leaves them with him. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade this. It is said that because it is ambiguous and uncertain whether it will be of benefit or not and whether the female will or will not be inseminated, it is presumable and involves uncertainty. Or the prohibition could be interpreted as a way of encouraging noble morals and recommending lending it without a return so animals would reproduce abundantly. This is something that Muslims should be willing to grant each other because it is one type of simple assistance that leads to the dominance of the spirit of cooperation and solidarity among people. In the Had\u012bth of Anas ibn M\u0101lik (may Allah be pleased with him) in At-Tirmidhi Collection, he reported: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) granted a concession in the honorarium, i.e., the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) permitted the acceptance of a gift given by the female owner as an honorarium, not as a compensation.\nHe also forbade selling water. It is said: The prohibition is general, as water should not be sold to Muslims given the fact that it is from their life necessities. In another version by Muslim, the prohibition has to do with \"selling excess water,\" which is the water exceeding the need of the well owner, his children, cattle, and crops. In the two Sah\u012bh Collections, Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Do not withhold excess water to prevent thereby excess herbage,\" which is the grass. This means: When a man owns a well in the desert and it has water that exceeds his needs and there is grass that has no other source of water except this water, the cattle owner cannot graze it unless they are watered from this well, in this case, it is unlawful for him to withhold this excess water from the cattle and he has to give it out without compensation.\nThe Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade land for cultivation, i.e., leasing it for cultivation. This is when a man gives his land to someone to cultivate in return for taking a share of his produce. This has many forms, as the Companions used to cultivate the land in return for one-third, one-fourth, or half its fruits during the lifetime of the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). In the two Sah\u012bh Collections and Musnad of Ahmad Collection - and this is the wording of Ahmad - Hanzhalah ibn Qays reported that R\u0101fi\u2018 ibn Khad\u012bj said: \"The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade leasing farms. He said: I said: Even if it is in return for gold and silver? He said: No, but he forbade it in return for part of its produce, but in return for gold and silver, there is no harm in it.\" In a version by Muslim: \"As for something known and guaranteed, there is nothing wrong with it.\" This Had\u012bth indicates that what the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) has forbidden was something clearly evil, namely the unfair and unjust Muz\u0101ra\u2018ah (sharecropping). This is why he prohibited it; however, there is nothing wrong with something known and guaranteed in dinar and dirham, as mentioned in the Had\u012bths and narrations.\nThe Had\u012bth encourages the act of giving excess water for free without demanding compensation.."}, {"number": 547, "hadith": "R\u0101fi\u2018 ibn Kahd\u012bj reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  \"The price of a sold dog is evil, the earning of a prostitute is evil, and the earning of a cupper is evil.\".", "commentary": "Allah has made what is good lawful for His slaves and has made unlawful for them whatever is evil from among food, drink, gains, trade, etc. Shariah has also urged Muslims to have self-esteem and to look down on lowly things.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"The price of a sold dog is evil,\" i.e., unlawful. This means that the price of selling or buying it or what is earned from that is ill-gotten money because it is prohibited to own or raise dogs except for dogs that are used in guarding livestock or farming. It is said: This is a general ruling, whether it is trained to hunt or untrained, and whether it is permissible to keep it or not. It is also said: The dog used in guarding and hunting is an exception because it is useful, as mentioned in the Sunan At-Tirmidhi Collection from the Had\u012bth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him): \"Except for the hunting dog.\" The version of Ad-D\u0101raqutni reads: \"Except for the dog trained to hunt,\" which is the one accustomed to hunting. It is as if the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade the price of the dog except for the dog that is permitted to be kept for a certain benefit, or perhaps the prohibition of the dog's price was at the beginning of Islam. Then it was abrogated later, and it became permissible to use it in hunting and, thus became like all the birds of prey in terms of the permissibility of selling it.\nLikewise, the money the adulteress takes in return for adultery and for giving herself to a foreign man is unlawful because adultery is unlawful, and the money gained therefrom is unlawful. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) called it \"dowry\" because it takes the form of a dowry, as it is paid in return for being allowed by the woman to have intercourse with her. In the pre-Islamic era of ignorance, they used to force their slave girls to commit adultery and take it as a means of earning money. But Islam criticized this, as Allah Almighty says: {Do not compel your slave girls into prostitution \u2013 if they wish to keep chaste \u2013 seeking the worldly gains of this life. But if anyone compels them, then Allah, after such a compulsion, is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.} [Surat an-N\u016br: 33]\n\"And the earnings of a cupper are evil.\" \"Hajj\u0101m\" (cupper) is the one making Hij\u0101mah (cupping), which means drawing blood from veins and removing the bad blood from the body. Being an evil earning does not mean it is unlawful because the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had Hij\u0101mah made for him and he paid the cupper a fee, as mentioned in the Two Sah\u012bh Collections from the Had\u012bth of Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him and his father). Had it been unlawful, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would not have given him. So, the Had\u012bths that forbid the cupper's earnings and clearly state that they are evil are interpreted in the sense of encouraging the act of keeping away from and rising above this means of earning and promoting good morals and noble things. Or perhaps the prohibition was at the beginning of Islam, then it was abrogated. So, when he gave the cupper his fee, this abrogated the previous ruling.."}, {"number": 548, "hadith": "J\u0101bir ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h reported:  The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commanded us to kill dogs; even when a woman brought her dog along with her from the desert, we used to kill it. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade killing them and said: Restrict yourselves to the pitch-black one that has two spots, for it is a devil..", "commentary": "The pure Shariah has regulated the rulings of everything even animals, which include dogs.

Afterwards, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade killing dogs except for the pitch-black dog, the one that is totally black, \"that has two spots,\" i.e., the two white spots above his eyes, as this dog is to be killed. His saying: \"For it is a devil\", means either in the true sense of the word for being pure harm that is void of any benefit or it is far from being beneficial and close to being harmful and detrimental, which is the case with the devil. So, this is a simile where the black dog is likened to the devil given its malice and because the black dog is the worst of dogs, the least in benefit, the most harmful, and the most mordacious.\nIt was authentically reported in other Had\u012bths that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade killing dogs except for the mordacious dog that hurts people, which should be killed, as mentioned in the Had\u012bth of \u2018\u0100\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) in the two Sah\u012bh Collections: \"Five animals are all vicious and harmful and are to be killed inside the Sacred Precincts: the crow, the kite, the scorpion, the mouse, and the mordacious dog.\"\nIn this Had\u012bth and similar ones, there is a prohibition of killing dogs, apart from those excluded, which are kept for benefiting from them in guarding, hunting, etc. It is said: Rather, he commanded killing them at first because people were so accustomed to having them, and dogs used to share with them their utensils. So, he wanted to wean them off that and, thus, gave the command of killing. However, when the idea of their filthiness and keeping them away became firmly established in themselves, he forbade this. Such a prohibition abrogated that command.

He addressed his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) in a sermon that he delivered in Mad\u012bnah saying: \"O People, Allah Almighty is alluding to intoxicants,\" i.e., He is mentioning it without prohibiting it or making it unlawful, in reference to the verse in which Allah Almighty says: {They ask you about intoxicants and gambling. Say, \u201cIn both, there is a great sin, and some benefits for people, but their sin is far greater than their benefit.\u201d} [Surat al-Baqarah: 219] And His saying: {O you who believe, do not approach the prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying.} [Surat an-Nis\u0101\u2019: 43] The two verses include a reference and a hint that intoxicants will be inevitably prohibited. Hence, as a word of advice, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ordered his Companions that whoever had something of such intoxicants should either sell it or benefit from it before it is completely prohibited in such a way that would make it impermissible to either sell it or benefit from it. This is because some of them used to work and trade in intoxicants and others used to keep and store them. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) wanted to protect their properties, and only a short while after the Prophet's advice, Allah revealed the prohibition of intoxicants in His Book saying: {O you who believe, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters, and divining arrows are of Satan\u2019s evil work; therefore, avoid such [evil], so that you may be successful.} [Surat al-M\u0101\u2019idah: 90] When it was revealed, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) informed them that whoever learned about this verse must \"neither drink it nor sell it.\" So, all those who had something of the intoxicants poured it all out in the streets of Mad\u012bnah.\nThe Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) understood from the Prophet's prohibition of its drinking and selling that it must not also be used in any aspect. Hence, they hastened to pour it out and ruin it. Had it contained any permissible benefit, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would have called attention to it.\nThe Had\u012bth indicates how the ruler should take care of his Ummah's interests, prepare people, and gradually issue rulings, especially concerning matters that are deeply rooted in the society.\nIt also shows how a true believer hastens to respond to Allah's command.."}, {"number": 550, "hadith": "\u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n ibn Wa\u2018lah as-Saba\u2019i (from the people of Egypt) reported:  That he asked \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s about what is squeezed from grapes.

Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked him: Did you know that Allah Almighty has forbidden it? Perhaps the question was intended to find out about his stance, for if he knew about its prohibition, he would object upon him for giving it as a gift, holding and carrying it, and he would be subject to discretionary punishment. However, when he informed him that he did not know about it, he excused him. It is possible that the man was among those outside Mad\u012bnah before the ruling of its prohibition spread. So, the man negated having any knowledge about its prohibition and its unlawfulness. This man whispered secretly to another man beside him without letting the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) hear him. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), thus, asked him: \"What did you whisper to him?\" The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked him about what he whispered only because he probably thought that his words to the other man had to do with this wine, so he wanted to clarify to him the comprehensiveness of the ruling of Khamr and how the prohibition is not just about drinking it as will be clarified later. The man answered the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) saying: \"I ordered him to sell it.\" In a version by Ahmad: \"The man went to his servant and said: Go and sell it,\" whereupon, he (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"The One Who has forbidden drinking it has forbidden selling it,\" so selling it is just as prohibited as drinking it. His saying: \"The One,\" is an indirect reference to the name of Allah Almighty, as if he said: Allah has forbidden drinking it and has forbidden selling it. It could also mean: What required the prohibition of drinking it required the prohibition of selling it, since it could only be wanted for drinking, so, if drinking is forbidden, then the sale is impermissible as it is deemed to be consumption of property wrongfully. So, the man opened the Maz\u0101dah - which is the waterskin - and poured out what was in it and got rid of it.\nWhat is apparent from the reporting of Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) is that this Had\u012bth is an answer to the question of \u2018Abdur-Rahm\u0101n ibn Wa\u2018lah is to make it clear that the prohibition is relevant to whatever is considered Khamr, is intoxicating, and causes one to lose control of his mental faculties, whether it is made from grapes or other things.\nThe Had\u012bth highlights the Prophet's good approach of teaching.\nIt points out the prohibition of selling intoxicants.\nIt indicates that whoever presents something unlawful as a gift, his gift must not be accepted.\nIt signifies that whoever commits a sin without knowing about its prohibition incurs no sin and must not be subject to discretionary punishment.."}, {"number": 551, "hadith": "\u2018Uthm\u0101n ibn \u2018Aff\u0101n reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  Do not sell a dinar for two dinars or a dirham for two dirhams..", "commentary": "Riba (usury) is one of the types of exploitation in transactions.

Riba has various types, all of which are prohibited. Riba al-Fadl (usury of surplus) is one type and it means selling an item that is subject to Riba rulings for another of the same type with excess in one of the two, like selling a gold dinar for two dinars and a silver dirham for two dirhams, which have been prohibited by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in this Had\u012bth.\nAn example of this is selling new gold or silver coins for those that weigh more, thus, taking in return for every one coin two old gold or silver coins. The Shariah states that such a sale is not to be concluded unless they are both alike and equal in weight, regardless of the quality or the inferiority, and on condition that the two currencies are present during the sale transaction and are exchanged hand to hand. So, equality and exchange during the contract session are conditions when selling an item for another item of the same type. However, if the type varies and the cause remains - like selling gold for silver - equality is no longer required, but exchange during the contract session is still a condition, as the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said in Sah\u012bh Muslim Collection: \"If these classes differ, sell as you wish as long as payment is made hand to hand.\"\nThe Had\u012bth indicates the prohibition of Riba al-Fadl (usury of surplus).."}, {"number": 552, "hadith": "M\u0101lik ibn Aws ibn al-Hadath\u0101n reported: I came saying: \"Who will exchange the dirhams?\" Talhah ibn \u2018Ubaydullah, who was with \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b, said: \"Show us your gold, then come to us when our servant comes to give you your silver.\" Thereupon, \u2018Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b said: \"No, by Allah, you must either give him his silver (now) or give him back his gold, for the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  'Silver for gold is Riba (usury) unless they are exchanged on the spot; wheat for wheat is Riba unless they are exchanged on the spot; barley for barley is Riba unless they are exchanged on the spot; and dried dates for dried dates is Riba unless they are exchanged on the spot.'\".", "commentary": "Riba (usury) is one of the types of exploitation in transactions.

He explained that by quoting the statement of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): \"Silver for gold is Riba,\" i.e., selling silver for gold is Riba (usury) in all cases \"unless they are exchanged on the spot,\" i.e., except in the case of physical presence and the immediate exchange of items hand to hand. Likewise, selling \"Burr\" - which is wheat - for Burr, selling barley for barley, and selling dried dates for dried dates all constitute Riba in all cases except in the case of physical presence and the immediate exchange of items hand to hand.\nThe Had\u012bth denotes the prohibition of the Nas\u012b\u2019ah Riba (usury of deferred payment).\nIt also encourages the act of forbidding evil for whoever has the ability to do so.\nIt points out that the evidence should be mentioned when forbidding evil.\nIt also shows that some knowledge may not be known to an old man until someone else reminds him of it.."}, {"number": 553, "hadith": "Abu Qil\u0101bah reported:  I was in the Levant in a circle and Muslim ibn Yas\u0101r was there. There came Abu al-Ash\u2018ath. He said: They said: Abu al-Ash\u2018ath, Abu al-Ash\u2018ath. So, he sat down. I said to him: Narrate to our brother the Had\u012bth of \u2018Ub\u0101dah ibn as-S\u0101mit. He said: Yes. We set out on an expedition while Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah was the leader of the people, and we gained a lot of spoils. There were silver utensils among such spoils, so Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah ordered a man to sell them for the people's payments. The people hastened to that. On hearing about it, 'Ub\u0101dah ibn as-S\u0101mit stood up and said: Verily, I heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbidding the sale of gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dry dates for dry dates, and salt for salt except equal for equal and like for like. So, whoever made or accepted an addition has committed Riba (usury). Thereupon, the people returned what they had taken. On hearing about it, Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah stood up and delivered a sermon saying: What is the matter with some men narrating from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) Had\u012bths that we had not heard from him although we saw and accompanied him?! Thereupon, \u2018Ub\u0101dah ibn as-S\u0101mit stood up and repeated the story, then said: We will surely narrate what he heard from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) even if Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah disliked this, or he said, Even if it is against his will. I do not mind if I do not accompany him in his troops on a black night..", "commentary": "The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used to advise one another in all states. They used to convey the Shariah-related commands and prohibitions without showing favoritism to or fear of a ruler or a caliph, and they would all comply with the truth.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Abu Qil\u0101bah \u2018Abdullah ibn Zayd reports that he was in the Levant - which is currently Syria, Jordan, Palestine, and Lebanon - and was sitting in a circle that was attended by the T\u0101bi\u2018i Muslim ibn Yas\u0101r. They were probably holding a gathering of knowledge. Then, Abu al-Ash\u2018ath Shar\u0101h\u012bl ibn \u0100dah came and sat with them. Abu Qil\u0101bah said to him: \"Narrate to our brother\" referring to Muslim ibn Yas\u0101r. Abu al-Ash\u2018ath responded to him and narrated to him the Had\u012bth of the Companion \u2018Ub\u0101dah ibn as-S\u0101mit (may Allah be pleased with him) and reported that they fought a battle, led by Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah ibn Abi Sufy\u0101n (may Allah be pleased with him and his father), and the Muslims gained a lot of spoils. \"Ghan\u012bmah\" (spoils): it is everything Muslims take from the disbelievers' properties after overpowering and conquering them. There were silver utensils among the spoils, so Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) commanded a man to sell them in dirhams as a deferred payment from the people's payments. \"U'tiy\u0101t\" (payments) is the plural of \"u'tiyah\", and it refers here to what the country gives the soldiers as a regular payment monthly or annually. This means: He ordered these silver utensils to be sold in dirhams as a deferred payment until the buyers received their salaries. So, people from the army havetened to buy these utensils in return for deferred dirhams until it was time for them to receive their wages. \u2018Ub\u0101dah ibn as-S\u0101mit (may Allah be pleased with him), who was present in the army, learned about this, so he stood up and delivered a sermon saying: Verily, I heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbidding the sale of gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dry dates for dry dates, and salt for salt except equal for equal and like for like, i.e., The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade selling these similar types in all cases unless they are like for like, i.e., equal in weight, and are visible, and present not absent, as mentioned in the two Sah\u012bh Collections: \"Do not sell available money for something absent.\"\nThe one who gives excess and the one who asks for it each of them has committed the prohibited Riba (usury), and both are equally sinful.\nOn hearing this, the people returned the utensils they had taken to the man who had sold them to them. When Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) heard about the Had\u012bth that was narrated by \u2018Ub\u0101dah, he stood up and delivered a sermon saying: \"What is the matter with some men?\" alluding to what 'Ub\u0101dah (may Allah be pleased with him) had said, \"narrating from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) Had\u012bths that we had not heard from him although we saw\" him, i.e., we used to be in his presence and accompany him in his journeys. It seems that Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) neither heard nor knew about this Had\u012bth, as was the case with others who did not know about it initially. The fact that he (may Allah be pleased with him) did not hear it does not serve as proof. Thereupon, Ub\u0101dah ibn as-S\u0101mit (may Allah be pleased with him) stood up when Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah criticized him, and repeated the Had\u012bth once again and said: \"We will surely narrate,\" i.e., we will surely tell people \"what he heard from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) even if Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah disliked it,\" referring to Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah ibn Abi Sufy\u0101n, the army leader, or he said: \"Even if it is against his will,\" i.e., even if he is disgraced and stuck to dust. Then, he said: \"I do not mind if I do not accompany him,\" i.e., I do not care about not accompanying him, and I do not want to be employed among his soldiers, and I want to part with him on a black night, i.e., dark and moonless.\nThe Had\u012bth signifies the keenness to convey the Sunnah acts and spread knowledge even if it is against the will of anyone.\nIt highlights the prohibition of Riba.\nIt stresses that the truth should be declared even if the one to whom it is declared is senior.."}, {"number": 554, "hadith": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said:  Gold for gold, weight for weight, like for like; and silver for silver, weight for weight, like for like.

It entails great harm and involves unlawful earnings and taking extra money wrongfully. Therefore, it has been prohibited in all the laws that have been revealed. Riba has various types, all of which are prohibited. Riba al-Fadl (usury of surplus) is one type of it; it means selling an item that is subject to Riba rulings for another of the same kind with excess in one of the two, like selling a gold dinar for two dinars and a silver dirham for two dirhams. Hence, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ordered us in this Had\u012bth to sell gold for gold - whether in the form of gold dinars or others - weight for weight and like for like without addition or reduction, so, both should be similar in weight and equal. Likewise, silver is to be sold for silver - whether in the form of silver dirhams or others - weight for weight and like for like without addition or reduction, so both should be equal in weight. Whoever gives more or takes more has committed unlawful Riba.\nOther versions have clarified that if the types vary, then selling with a surplus is permissible; however, the sale should not be for a deferred payment; rather, it should be immediate, as the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said in the two Sah\u012bh Collections - and this is the wording of Al-Bukh\u0101ri -: \"And sell gold for silver and silver for gold as you wish.\" In Sah\u012bh Muslim Collection: \"If these classes differ, sell as you wish as long as payment is made hand to hand.\"\nThe Had\u012bth highlights the prohibition of Riba al-Fadl (usury of surplus).\nIt stresses the prohibition of all transactions that entail harm to people in terms of their properties and relations.."}, {"number": 555, "hadith": "Hanash reported:  We were along with Fad\u0101lah ibn' Ubayd on an expedition.

A necklace, a piece of women's jewelry worn around the neck, from the spoils fell to his lot along with a group of his companions and it had gold, silver, and jewels like pearls and the like.

Thereupon, Fad\u0101lah (may Allah be pleased with him) ordered him to remove and separate its gold and place it in a balance pan - where the weighed item is put - and to put his gold on the opposite pan so there would be equality between the two amounts of gold without any surplus, and this could not be known except by separating it from the jewels. Then, he should not take of its gold except for like of his own gold that he deemed a payment for it so that he would not give or take any extra and, thus, engage in unlawful Riba. Likewise, the silver in it should be sold for an equal weight, and other jewels should be sold at their price for cash. He then justified this by saying that he heard the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) say: \"Whoever believes in Allah\" Who created him and has full faith in Him \"and the Last Day\", which is the Day of Judgment to which he will return and on which he will receive recompense for his deeds, should not buy gold or silver except like for like in terms of weight without any addition or surplus.\nThe Had\u012bth emphasizes the prohibition of Riba, as it linked its prohibition to belief in Allah and the Last Day.."}, {"number": 556, "hadith": "Fad\u0101lah ibn \u2018Ubayd reported:  We were with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) on the Day of Khaybar, making deals with the Jews with the Wuqiyyah of gold for two or three dinars, whereupon the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: Do not sell gold for gold except weight for weight..", "commentary": "Riba (usury) is one of the types of exploitation in transactions.

The boy went and bought one S\u0101\u2018 of barley and part of a S\u0101 in return for the wheat directly without selling the wheat first and then buying the barley with its price.

You committed Riba (usury)! Do not approach this.

The Shariah has forbidden all sales that involve a possibility of Riba and has permitted lawful sales that are free of Riba. The pre-Islamic era of ignorance was swarming with Riba-based sales, so Islam rectified and refined such sale transactions.\nIn this Had\u012bth, the T\u0101bi\u2018i Abu Nadrah al-Mundhir ibn M\u0101lik al-\u2018Abdi narrates that he asked the Companion \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) about Sarf, which is selling an item for another of the same type with a surplus and an addition in the taken or given item, like selling a dinar for two dinars or a dirham for two dirhams; whether it is a Riba-based sale or not. Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s answered by saying that it is not Riba in case it is exchanged hand to hand, i.e., at the time that the act of selling took place. Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) did not deem selling an item for another of the same type with a surplus Riba, and he believed that Riba is not unlawful except in case of a deferred payment.\nSo, Abu Nadrah informed Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) about the Fatwa of Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s, whereupon Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd (may Allah be pleased with him) told him that he would write to Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s not to give such a Fatwa and would review it with him, clarify the truth, and advise him. Then, Abu Sa\u2018\u012bd (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated his supporting reference and evidence in forbidding the Riba of surplus and addition. He swore and said: \"By Allah, some of the boys of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him),\" who are the servants, \"brought dry dates, but he rejected them,\" the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) rejected them because they were not from the dry dates produced by their land and not the ones known among them. It was said to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): This year, the dry dates of Mad\u012bnah were of bad quality. So, the servant took some of the bad dry dates and exchanged them for others and brought those good dry dates to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) in return for the defective ones and gave the buyer an excess in the weight and amount of the defective dry dates. Thereupon, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"You made an addition! You committed Riba (usury)! Do not approach this,\" i.e., what you did and the addition you made in the weight is from Riba. So, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade him from eating from the dry dates he had brought. Then, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to him by way of teaching: \"If you find some doubt about your dry dates, sell them and then buy the dry dates you like,\" thus, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade him from taking dry dates for dry dates. So, if there was something wrong with his dry dates, he should first sell them for money, then buy with that money whatever he liked of the dry dates, and there should be no surplus between the two.\nIt seems that Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s gave that Fatwa of permissibility based on the apparent indication of the Prophet's statement mentioned in the two Sah\u012bh Collections: \"Riba is only in Nas\u012b\u2019ah (deferred payment).\" This apparently indicates exclusiveness, as if he said: There is no Riba except in the deferred payment. However, there is a report in the Sah\u012bh Muslim Collection indicating that Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s reconsidered his stance regarding his Fatwa, as Abu as-Sahb\u0101\u2019 narrated: \"That he asked Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s about it in Makkah, and he disliked it,\" i.e., he disliked the permissibility of surplus in Sarf.\nThe Had\u012bth highlights the prohibition of Riba al-Fadl (usury of surplus).\nIt indicates the invalidity of the transaction that involves Riba.\nIt highlights the fact that the Shariah rulings are to be sought only through the Qur\u2018an and the Sunnah.\nIt shows how the Companions used to correct each other whenever they made a mistake.."}]
